    <item><title><![CDATA[Ekkehart Malotki]]></title><description><![CDATA[(The dates we're providing here are for Malotki's research on the Hopi and Native American rock art.) Ekkehart Malotki (1936 - present) is best known for his work with the Hopi tribes. During his time at the Northern Univeristy of Arizona he debunked the myth that Hopi people were unaware of the concept of time and did not discuss it. Through one on one conversations, old cliff drawings, and observations he proved that in fact the Hopi did understand time, just as he hypothesised. It is part of a human nature to understand time. He was also able to translate their language fully into English which no one was able to completely do before him. Dr. Malotki wrote two main books on his findings entitled; Hopi time, and Hopi dictionary along; along with many children's books he learned about Hopi myth and tradition. He taught German, Latin, and Hopi from 1997 - 2004, and as professor emeritus, he's still writing and publishing in the past few years on the Hopi.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Sound Recording]]></title><description><![CDATA[In 1857, Ã‰douard-LÃ©on Scott de Martinville invented the phonautograph, the very first device capable of recording sound waves as they passed through the air. It was only intended for visual study of the recording and could not play back sound.  Many of scientists attempted to create a device where they could capture and keep recorded sound, but none were successful until 1887, when inventor Emile Berliner photoengraved a phonautograph recording into metal and played the recording back. 
        
In 1878, Thomas Edison perfected the phonograph, which was a device with a cylinder covered with an impressionable material such as tin foil, lead, or wax on which a stylus etched grooves. The depth of the grooves made by the stylus corresponded to change in air pressure created by the original sound. The recording could be played back by tracing a needle through the groove and amplifying the vibrations. 

Electrical recording began in 1925 and the recording process drastically improved the quality of the recording process of disc records.  Electrically powered phonographs were introduced and sold in 1930, but electronic reproduction did not become common until the late 1930â€™s.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Benito Cereno]]></title><description><![CDATA[Herman Melville wrote Benito Cereno in 1855. Melville backdated the setting of this novella to 1799. Captain Delano sees a strange ship off the coast of Chile. Looking closer, Captain Delano sees the ship, Saint Dominick, is full of blacks. On this ship is where he sees Benito Cereno. Cereno and Delano begin to speak of the horrible conditions of the boat. The blacks on this ship have the same rights as the whites, and Delano sees different fights between the people on the ship. Delano eventually figures out that the blacks are in charge on the Saint Dominick. Babo, a black slave, leads the rebellion and tries to kill Delano. At the end of the story, Babo is killed and Benito Cereno dies as well.
        
The photo is of two men playing Benito Cereno and Babo in the play Benito Cereno. This play was a retelling of the famous novella, held at the Flea Theater in New Yorkâ€™s Manhattan Tribeca in 2011.

    <item><title><![CDATA["Bartleby the Scrivener"]]></title><description><![CDATA["Bartleby the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street" was published by Herman Melville in 1853. It is a story about a lawyer who hires a quiet, antisocial man named Bartleby to be a scrivener in his office. Bartleby works well at first, and then gradually refuses to do anything the narrator asks him. He does this by using the famous saying "I prefer not to." It is then revealed that Bartleby is living in his office. Instead of firing him, the narrator moves his practice to another building. The people who run the new practice that replaces the narrator's practice finds Bartleby still living in his old office. They complain to the narrator, who still refuses to do anything. Eventually they call the police and Bartleby is sent to jail, where he prefers not to eat. The narrator visits Bartleby but cannot reach him. The story ends with Bartleby starving to death and the narrator finding out that he used to work in the dead letter office. This narrator in this story is obtuse because he could not understand why Bartleby was behaving the way he was. Being a lawyer, all he knew were the ways of wall street and rich people. Bartleby's passive resistance had a huge effect on the narrator as well as other workers in the office. Throughout the story, Bartleby teaches the narrator to have a sense of empathy, a trait which Melville thinks all of humanity should posses as shown in the ending ling "Ah Bartleby! Ah Humanity! The video provides an analysis of the major themes within the story.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=4s-eJCpU06I</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >4s-eJCpU06I</guid><pubDate>Fri, 1 Jul 1853 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA[Fugitive Slave Acts: 1793 and 1850]]></title><description><![CDATA[In researching the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, I was surprised to learn that there was an original Fugitive Slave Act, from 1793. The original law was loosely upheld, though. Slaves and abolitionists used the Underground Railroad to circumvent the law. And in a major case in Pennsylvania, in 1842, the court ruled that states were not required to adhere the the original Slave Act.
        
In 1850, the country being divided as it was, Henry Clay set out to preserve the Union. He drafted the Compromise of 1850, which included The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. There were other points in the compromise, including land property matters. The new Fugitive Slave Act required citizens to assist in the capture of slaves, and slaves were not allowed a jury trial. Slave "hunters" were allowed to find and capture escaped slaves. And because the slaves were denied the proper trial, free African-Americans were forced into slavery, as well.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=zkPOKQqGHks</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >zkPOKQqGHks</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 1850 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><georss:point>38.8951100, -77.0363700</georss:point></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA["Annabel Lee" ]]></title><description><![CDATA[â€œAnnabel Leeâ€ is the last complete poem written by Edgar Allan Poe. The poem was not published until after Poe died in 1849. The poem is a great example of a gothic 
piece with the common theme of death. In the poem, the narrator describes the love he has for Annabel, which started at a very young age. When his beloved Annabel dies, he is devastated but still believes that their souls are intertwined because their love is so strong. He lies beside her dead body in her tomb by the sea. This shows a breaking of the barrier between the living and dead worlds. The poem incorporates the idea of necrophilia because the narrator is still in love with his wifeâ€™s dead body. He is clinging to Annabel and the past in a very obsessive way. He is unable to move on and let go of the past. He would rather sleep with a decomposing dead body than let her go. It may seem sweet that the narrator is so in love with his wife that he cannot bear to let her go, but laying in a tomb with her dead body is extremely obsessive and border- line insanity. It is unknown who the inspiration for the poem was, if there even was one at all. Many biographers believe that Poeâ€™s wife, Virginia, was the inspiration because he loved her as a child and had died two years prior to the poem being written. Other 
possible inspirations include Poeâ€™s mother and foster mother, Frances Sargent Osgood, and other women who claim be the inspiration.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Married Women's Property Laws]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some of the first successes of the first wave of Feminism and the social movement for womenâ€™s rights came in the laws/acts regarding womenâ€™s property rights. â€œMarried women's property acts differ in language, and their dates of passage span many years. One of the first was enacted by Connecticut in 1809, allowing women to write wills. The majority of states passed similar statutes in the 1850s.â€ Several states also adopted New Yorkâ€™s 1848 Property Act (referenced below).
        
New Yorkâ€™s 1848 Property Act:
â€œAN ACT for the effectual protection of the property of married women - Passed April 7, 1848.
The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly do enact as follows:
Sec. 1. The real and personal property of any female who may hereafter marry, and which she shall own at the time of marriage, and the rents issues and profits thereof shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts, and shall continue her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female.
Sec. 2 The real and personal property, and the rents issues and profits thereof of any female now married shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband; but shall be her sole and separate property as if she were a single female except so far as the same may be liable for the debts of her husband heretofore contracted.
Sec. 3. It shall be lawful for any married female to receive, by gift, grant devise or bequest, from any person other than her husband and hold to her sole and separate use, as if she were a single female, real and personal property, and the rents, issues and profits thereof, and the same shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts.
Sec. 4. All contracts made between persons in contemplation of marriage shall remain in full force after such marriage takes place.â€

After the Civil War, Womenâ€™s Property laws were concerned with equalizing property relations between husband and wife giving each spouse assets separate from communal property.  â€œOne of the earliest mentions of the distinction between the wife's separate property and common property is in the California Constitution of 1849: Section 14: â€˜All property, both real and personal, of the wife, owned or claimed by her before marriage, and that acquired afterward by gift, devise, or descent, shall be her separate property; and laws shall be passed more clearly defining the rights of the wife in relation as well to her separate property, as to that held in common with her husband.â€™â€ Although some states passed acts distinguishing separate and common property within the marriage, husbands held dominance over the coupleâ€™s assets. As seen in Art 2852 of 1879 Texas Law below the time period of marriage is termed coverture insinuating the husbandsâ€™ head of house, asset covering/handling of the coupleâ€™s mutual property. However, Art 2181 allows for widows to obtain equal property rights as widowers (a big step for Womenâ€™s Property Rights).

1879 Texas Married Womenâ€™s Property Law:
â€œArt. 2181. The surviving wife may retain the exclusive management, control and disposition of the community property of herself and her deceased husband in the same manner, and subject to the same rights, rules and regulations as provided in the case of a surviving husband, until she may marry again. . . 
Art. 2852. All property acquired by either husband or wife during the marriage except that which is acquired by gift, devise or descent shall be deemed the common property of the husband and wife, and during the coverture may be disposed of by the husband only.â€ My source for the above information can be found at the linked website: http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awlaw3/property_law.html

Another good source of information on this matter:
Linda K. Kerber and Jane Sherron De Hart, Editors, Womenâ€™s America: Refocusing the Past. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995

I also thought the following description of the word coverture was helpful in understanding the weight of the term as it was used in the nineteenth century: â€œThe American form of coverture was, like much of early American law, heavily borrowed from the British common law system. Under coverture, women had no legal standing. As children, girls belonged to their fathers. At marriage, they were â€˜made one with,â€™ i.e., owned by their husbands. They could not own property, make contracts, or be sued. They could not borrow money, or be in business. They could not own anything. Not their clothes, not their bodies. Not even their own labor, be it the products of labor on a farm or the labor to bring children into the world. They were â€œcovered womenâ€â€“ covered under the law by their husbands, that isâ€ 
(http://feminspire.com/what-is-coverture-a-history-of-women-without-power/).

    <item><title><![CDATA["What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?"]]></title><description><![CDATA[Frederick Douglass was a well known abolitionist leader. On July 5th 1852 Douglass was asked by the Ladies Anti Slavery Society of Rochester to present a speech for a Fourth of July celebration. At this point Douglass had been a member of the Rochester society for many years, editing an abolitionist magazine. Douglass not only put himself in danger when he went up to speak because he was an escaped slave, but also just because the color of his skin. During this time period slaves where not allowed to participate in Fourth of July celebrations for slaveholders in the south feared it would create to many ideas of freedom. Even an escaped free slave in the North was discouraged from attending any celebration for they were not considered citizens. For these points it was quite a sight to see Douglass in front of a crowd preaching about freedom, although he did not necessarily give the typical freedom speech. "The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not me." Douglass turned the opportunity to present what freedom actually is in this country and if just because the founding fathers broke free from England if that means the country is actually free. Douglass presents his audience with antithesis of what they believe to be true to be what is seen through the views of a slave. The Fourth of
July speech given by Douglas was just one of the many eye opening forms of abolitionist literature presented during this highly controversial time.

However, in 1839 Melville accepted a position to travel as a crew member on a merchant ship called the St. Lawrence. This was Melville's first sea voyage. His second sea voyage would not turn out so successful as he was captured by cannibals on the island of Nukahiva. After four months, he was saved by an Australian vessel and finally reached New York. Much different experiences than his safe New York based character, Bartleby the scrivener.

In 1840, eight years before the Womenâ€™s Rights Convention in Rochester New York, she married abolitionist Henry Brewster. However, Stanton refused to include the word â€œobeyâ€ in their marriage ceremony. Love, cherish, but not to obey, Stanton insisted that this word be dropped from her vows and all brideâ€™s wedding vows (the word obey never appeared in the groomâ€™s vows). Elizabeth Cady Stanton made various critiques of â€œtraditionalâ€ norms, even extending to controversial critiques of womenâ€™s treatment in religion. These original brideâ€™s wedding vows reciting to â€œlove, cherish, and obeyâ€ was from the â€œBook of Common Prayerâ€, the oldest traditional wedding vows traced back to the Middle Ages.

    <item><title><![CDATA[The Liberator (Garrison's abolitionist newspaper)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Although born in Newbury, Massachusetts, William Lloyd Garrisonâ€™s reputation boomed following the release of his Boston abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator, in 1831. Garrison was at the forefront of a radical abolition movement that promoted civil equality among blacks and whites. Early in his life he was among the â€˜abolitionistâ€™ of the American Colonization Society that favored the return of slaves to Africa. Garrison realized around 1830 that the American Colonization Companyâ€™s â€œtrue objective was to minimize the amount of free slaves in the United Statesâ€ not true abolition (http://www.biography.com/people/william-lloyd-garrison-9307251?page=1). Although a radical in comparison to early â€˜abolitionistâ€™, Garrison would prove to fall short in later years as the call for abolition grew more radical. Garrison had a strong distaste for direct political action and favored pacifism behind the facade of his newspaper. However, Garrison was an early encourager of Frederick Douglass and did live to see the passing of the 13th amendment (outlawing slavery).
        
This video is a portion from the PBS special titled â€œThe Abolitionistsâ€ that premiered on January 8th, 2013. â€œThe Abolitionistsâ€ was produced as a special segment of the larger PBS series â€œAmerican Experience.â€ This clip illustrates Garrisonâ€™s encouragement for Douglass to publically join the abolitionist movement.

Interesting journal article that addresses the importance of Garrisonâ€™s use of rhetoric in the publishing of Douglassâ€™s narrative:

What makes Dickinson's poems special are that they are unconventional for their time. A lot of her poems deal with Transcendentalism. This concept is dealing with people becoming filled with knowledge and understanding how the world works. Dickinson is also interesting for her "Slant-Ryhme" and interchangeable lines. Instead of crossing out her work, she would reference the writer to alternate lines. This can change the poem a bit and lets the reader see the poets thinking process while writing. Dickinson continued to write unconventional works throughout her life but only a few were published , and edited at that. Her works didn't go fully public until after her death in 1886 were American's more modern ideals let them appreciate her works. ]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=BPAcr6UJJBU</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >BPAcr6UJJBU</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 1830 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><georss:point>42.037302,-71.683502</georss:point></item>

The two became close friends in 1850, which was the same year that Dickinson's brother began courting Susan. Our book mentions the ambiguous relationship the two women had, but nothing can be proved as to how intimate their relationship was. We do know that Susan received over 300 letters from Emily and more than 250 poems. We also know that Emily claimed to have learned more from Susan than any other person, save Shakespeare. Something our book doesn't mention: upon Emily's death, her sister, Lavinia, first asked Susan to edit the poems for publication. Lavinia did not have the patience for Susan's methodical pace, however, and then asked Mabel Loomis Todd and Thomas Wentworth Higginson to edit the work. A curious choice seeing as how Mabel Loomis Todd and Austin Dickinson had been in the middle of a thirteen-year affair, starting in 1882!]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=IJEnBtZCZdg</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >IJEnBtZCZdg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 1 Jul 1830 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><georss:point>42.3667, -72.5167</georss:point></item>

Though she was born into a succesful family, dickinson lived a very secluded life where she did not interact with many people. Her style of writing was very unique, her poems lacked titles, and she used slant words or rhymes. However what made them more unique was that most of her poems  themed about pain, suffering and death. Her type of writing was very dark and differed from most poetry. Dicksons work did not become aparent until after her death in 1886 when her family found most of her poems and published her first collection in 1890. ]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=AMydRKPgoWg</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >AMydRKPgoWg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 1 Jul 1830 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA["The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was published by Washington Irving in 1820. It is a part of a collection called The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon. It is the most famous story from the collection. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow tells the story of Ichabd Crane. He is a greedy, superstitious school teacher who tries to win over Katrina Von Tassel so he can get his hands on her family's wealth. He competes with Brom Bones, a strong prankster who is also in love with Katrina. One night, Katrina rejects Ichabod at a party at the Van Tassels'. On his way home from the party, he is stalked by what he thinks is the Headless Horseman, the ghost of a Hessian soldier whose head was knocked off by a cannonball during the Revolutionary War. Just when Ichabod thinks he escaped, the Headless Horseman throws his head at him and knocks him off his horse. The next day, Ichabod has disappeared and all that is left at the scene is his hat and a smashed pumpkin. This allows Brom to marry Karina and the townspeople to question whether the Headless Horseman spirited Ichabod away or not. Some believe he simply moved to a different town and became a judge, but the legend lives on. This story is part of the Romanticism movement because it uses elements of ghost stories in sleepy towns and displays Ichabod's sense of confusion and irrationality when it comes to the Headless Horseman. The 
Headless Horsemen itself is a connection to the Revolutionary War, a past event in America's history. This story is also a social satire because it makes fun of Ichabod's superstitious nature even though he is educated. Is also makes fun of Ichabod because he is inferior to Brom Bones even though he is supposedly smarter.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=sYIkNzYNiHg</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >sYIkNzYNiHg</guid><pubDate>Sat, 1 Jul 1820 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><georss:point>38.892091,-77.024055</georss:point></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA[Walt Whitman]]></title><description><![CDATA[Walt Whitman was an American poet. Some say he single handled revolutionized American poetry. Alot of people would not even think to write about some of the topics he would entertain. He had very strong ideas about women's rights, slavery, and immigration. In 1848 Whitman began Leaves of Grass. These poems grew and grew to over 300+ poems. These poems were unconventional and challenged American ideals of the time. Whitman then went on to move to Washington D.C. to help his wounded brother who fought in the Civil War. Whitman talked to many soldiers and from those accounts he wrote a collection of poems called "Drum taps". This was one of the only two recordings of the Civil War written by people who actually experienced it. After that, Whitman went on to write two more collections of poems. Whitman then died in March 26 in 1892. Without Whitman literature in America would not be the same without him "busting down the doors" of censorship. ]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=yeSvLDkDq3w</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >yeSvLDkDq3w</guid><pubDate>Thu, 1 Jul 1819 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><georss:point>38.892091,-77.024055</georss:point></item>

Although Rip does not know the men, he drinks alcohol with him, becomes drunk and then falls asleep. he wakes up twenty years later to find his dog gone, his rifle rusty, and his bread a foot long. When Rip descends the mountain, he finds his village to be very different. The people are all dressed strangely and the picture of King George in the inn is now replaced with a portrait of George Washington. The people in the village are all on their way to vote. The villagers are weary of because he comes to election with a gun in hand. When asked who he will be voting for, Rip answers that he is loyal to the King, completely unaware that the Revolutionary War has occurred. The people are outraged and accuse Rip of being a tory. When Rip explains who he is and what has happened to him, the villagers feel remorse for him. He then moves in with his grown daughter and enjoys life without his nagging wife. The story of Rip Van Winkle is an example of Romanticism, which Irving brought back from England. Rip experiences rapid change when he falls asleep in a static, stable village, to when he awakens and an new patriotic town. There is a strong sense of patriotism and freedom in the new American town. Rip is surprised and confused by the immense, seemingly rapid changes.

By the late 19th/early 20th century Scottish whalers would winter in Iglulik. In the 1920s, contact with missionaries and traders increased to change the society. In 1822, the community is estimated to have a population around 500; now the population is close to 1600. The area has been inhabited for 4,000 years and is rooted with a deep oral tradition similar to the other surrounding tribes. I have posted here a video of some Iglulik throat singing; examples of more "normal" singing exist from them, as well.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=M9xXfEa0yfE</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >M9xXfEa0yfE</guid><pubDate>Thu, 1 Jul 1819 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><georss:point>69.3761, -81.7994</georss:point></item>

    <item><title><![CDATA[Walt Whitman]]></title><description><![CDATA[Walt Whitman was an American writer, specifically a poet, and was considered to be one of the most influential poets in America. His work however is considered to be very controversial especially his poetry collection called Leaves of Grass. This collection of poetry is considered controversial because of the sexuality that is brought about throughout the poetry. Because of the amount of sexuality controversy over his poetry, Whitmanâ€™s sexuality is sometimes questioned and he was often considered to be homosexual or bisexual. Whitman started writing Leaves of Grass in 1850 and he wrote, revised, and rewrote it until he died. In this collection of poetry, Whitman discusses many topics such as American democracy, the body and soul, transcendentalism, realism, the idea of the self or individualism, and sexuality. Besides Leaves of Grass, other works by Whitman include Franklin Evans, Drum-Taps, Memoranda During the War, Specimen Days, and Democratic Vistas. Whitman is also said to be the poet of American democracy and a friend of his Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe, wrote: "You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without Leaves of Grass.â€ ]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=Ihay6C_BH_4</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >Ihay6C_BH_4</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 1819 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate></item>

Since slaves did not know their age, Douglass did not know his birthday. We know that he would have been born around 1818. As a child, Douglass was given to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Auld, who sent Douglass to Hugh Auld. Mrs. Auld taught Douglass how to read and write, which was late forbade by her husband. Since he could read, he read newspapers which is where he first learned about the word abolition. After a fight, Hugh Auld sent Douglass to Edward Covey, who was known for breaking slaves. Eventually, Douglass was free after trying to escape twice, succeeding his second time. He moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts and got married. In 1845, he wrote The Narrative of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. He continued to write throughout his life, including his newspaper, the North Star. He was an abolitionist and also supported womenâ€™s rights. Douglass and his first wife had five children. He died of a heart attack and is buried in New York.
        
** This video talks about slavery, and also shows a reenactment of what slave like Douglass faced. The video talks about key points we read about in the narrative, such as the encounter with Covey.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Fanny Fern]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sara Payson Willis, famously known as â€œFanny Fernâ€ was born July 9, 1811 to Deacon Nathaniel Willis and Hannah Parker in Portland, Maine.  Deacon Willis had owned his own Christian newspaper, The Puritan Recorder.  Sara enjoyed growing up in the home of a journalist, but was extremely rebellious of her parentâ€™s religious home environment. At age 16, Sara was sent to Catharine Beecherâ€™s Hartford Female Seminary in New Hampshire, where Beecherâ€™s younger sister, Harriet Beecher [Stowe] had taught for many years. Deacon Willis had sent her here in hopes to curb her rebellious attitude and aid in a sturdy education for his daughter. The seminary was considered the best education for young women in this time period by emphasizing the development of ideas over routine memorization. 
        
In 1837, Sara married a cashier at the Merchant's Bank of Boston by the name of Charles Harrington Eldredge, in which she gave birth to three daughters: Mary Stace (1838-1845), Grace Harrington (1841-1862), and Ellen Willis (1845-1922). Her oldest daughter, Mary Stace, passed away in 1845 due to brain fever (meningitis).  A year later, Eldredge passed of typhoid fever leaving Sara to financially fend for herself and her two children. In 1846, Sara asked her brother N.P. Willis, a journalist for The New York Home Journal, if he could help her out by publishing some of the material that she had written in desperation, but he rejected her requests. By the persistence of her father, in 1849, Sara married Samuel P. Farrington, a young merchant. Farrington proved to be abusive and resentful, leading to their divorce two years later. 

After the divorce, the writer â€œFanny Fernâ€ came to existence to earn support for her family. She chose the name â€œFanny Fernâ€ because her warm mother had loved the sweet fern; a sturdy plant that could survive hostile conditions. 

Her first publication, The Model Husband, appeared on June 28, 1851, in Boston's Olive Branch, edited by the Rev. Thomas F. Norris. In the summer of 1852, Fern was hired by the publisher Oliver Dyer at twice her salary to publish a regular column exclusively in his New York newspaper Musical World and Times, making her the first female in history to have her own newspaper column.  In 1853, Dyer had helped her find a publisher for her first two books, Fern Leaves from Fanny's Portfolio (1853) and Little Ferns for Fanny's Little Friends (1853). Her book sold 70,000 copies within the first year.

Weekly columns by "Fanny Fern" appeared in the Boston Olive Branch (28 June 1851 - 25 June), 1853), the Boston True Flag edited by William Moulton (29 November 1851 - 23 April 1853), the New York Musical World and Times published by Oliver Dyer (9 October 1852 - 19 November 1853), and the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post (7 January 1854 - 1 April 1854). All of her popularity had caused her editor, Robert Bonner, to make her the highest paying columnist of her time. 

In 1856, after having a prenuptial agreement drawn up, which gave Fern rights to her earnings before and after her marriage, she married James Parton. Parton was an editor at her brother, N.P. Willisâ€™s newspaper, but quit after Willis refused to publish any of Fanny Fernâ€™s work. 

Fanny Fern died of breast cancer in New York City on October 10, 1872. She was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, alongside her first two daughters and first husband. A large fern-embossed stone cross marks her grave. Fanny Fern will always be remembered for her ambition and determination in becoming and tabloid legend.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Wendell Phillips]]></title><description><![CDATA[Wendell Phillips was a Harvard Law graduate and owner of his own law firm. During his career there was a riot outside of his office in the streets of Boston about the anti-slavery movement. Phillips was able to calm the riot with an impromptu speech of abolitionist, since that moment he left the practice of law and focused solely on the rights of escaped slaves. People call Phillips the backbone of the abolitionist movement, for although his friend and abolitionist leader William Llyod Harrison was known as the voice of the movement, many of his speeches and written works where co-written by Phillips. Phillips was very dedicated to the abolitionist movement that when he gave up his law firm his family and friends became so concerned that they actual tried to commit him to a psych ward. Yet, nothing could deter Phillips from the cause, he even spoke directly to President Lincoln during the Civil War in an effort to make slavery illegal. Once the cause was seem to be won, Phillips did not step back, he focused his new effort on the feminist movement. Phillips never saw people for the color of skin or their gender, he just saw every person as equal and deserving respect; which is what he dedicated his life to.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Edgar Allan Poe]]></title><description><![CDATA[Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston in 01809 to two traveling actors. He was the middle child of three kids, but, by the time he was three years old, both of his parents had passed away. He then moves to Richmond to live with his foster parents, John Allan and Frances Valentine Allan. Though he was told not to, he had enough poems by age thirteen to publish his own
book. He decided to attend the University of Virginia in 1826, but, by the end of his first semester, he had become so poor that he turned to burning his furniture for warmth. When he finally returned home, he found that his fiancÃ©e, Elmira Royster, was engaged to someone else. This, however, did not get in the way of his dreams. By the age of eighteen, he had published his first book entitled "Tamerlane" and he also became enlisted in the army. When he returned, he decided to look up his family, realizing that both of his foster parents had passed away. He went to live with his Aunt Clem, and soon fell in love with her daughter, Virginia. He married Virginia when he was 27 years old and she inspired his poem called "Eulalie." He moved to Philadelphia in 1838, and became editor for magazines, such as Burton's and Graham's. When Poe finally published his first book of short stories, "Tales of Grotesque and Arabesque," he was surprisingly let down. He was paid only in twenty five free copies of his book. He went to New York in the year 1844 and, in January of 1845, published "The Raven," which made his famous. He published two books that year and he gained ownership of the Broadway Journal; however, he left in 1846 because of the rumors of him having an affair with a married woman. He moved into a small cottage with his wife, who died during the winter of 1847 from Tuberculosis. Poe lived only two more years while lecturing and working on a new magazine, The Stylus. He dies on October 7, 1849 at forty years of age. His death still remains a mystery.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Sojourner Truth]]></title><description><![CDATA[Isabella Baumfree, famously known as Sojourner Truth, was born into slavery in New York in 1797. She was sold multiple times, and while under ownership of the Dumont family, married another slave of the family, Thomas. Isabella and Thomas had five children together. In 1827, New York had passed a law that emancipated all slaves, but Isabella had already left her husband and fled with her youngest child. 
        
	She soon became a worker for the Isaac Van Wagenen family. While under employment of the Isaac Van Wagenen family, Isabella heard word that her son had been sold into slavery in Alabama by the Dumont family, in which she sued in court and won ownership of him. 
	
	Isabella underwent religious conversion and decided to travel to New York to a Methodist perfectionist commune. Shortly after, she was influenced by a religious prophet named Mathias. Under corruption, the commune fell apart. Many were accused of sexual allegations and even murder. Isabella was accused of poisoning and sued for libel and won the case. She continued to work as a household servant.
	In 1843, Isabella adopted the name Sojourner Truth believing that the Holy Spirit placed her on this earth to become a traveling preacher and preach the word of God.  In the late 1840â€™s, she connected with many abolitionists and became a popular abolitionist speaker.  She continued into the 1850â€™s to preach about womenâ€™s suffrage. In 1851, she gave one of the most famous speeches of her life, â€œAinâ€™t I a Womanâ€ at the womenâ€™s right convention in Ohio.
	Sojourner Truth met Harriet Beecher Stowe and became a topic of her discussion in the â€œAtlantic Monthlyâ€.  Stowe went on to write the introduction for Truthâ€™s autobiography, The Narrative of Sojourner Truth.  Sojourner moved to Michigan and became a member of another commune which was associated with the Friends.  She was at one point involved with Millerites, a famous religious movement that grew out of Methodism and later became the Seventh Day Adventists.
	During the Civil War, Truth raised clothing and food contributions for African American troops and went on to meet President Abraham Lincoln at the White House in 1864. While visiting, she challenged segregation and discrimination that segregated street cars by race.
	After the war, Sojourner Truth continued to give speeches advocating for a â€œNegro Stateâ€ in the west. She spoke to audiences that were majority white to educate them on religion, "Negro" and women's rights, and temperance. She also attempted to provide jobs for black refugees in the war.
	In 1875, Sojourner Truthâ€™s companion and grandson fell ill and died. Truth returned to Michigan where shortly after her health deteriorated leading to her death in 1883. She passed away in a sanatorium of Battle Creek with infected ulcers in her legs. She was buried in Battle Creek Michigan. Her funeral was marked in history as one of the most attended. 
Sojourner Truth is remembered for her courageous and charitable acts during the civil war for black individuals. She has impacted history with her vocalizations against slavery and global discrimination. She will forever be remembered as one of the most influential speakers and activists of her time.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Ben Franklins' On the Slave Trade is published]]></title><description><![CDATA["On the Slave Trade" was a piece written by Benjamin Franklin just 3 weeks before his death. The was a satirical piece who's purpose was to show the English men that the ways of keeping slaves is immoral. The letter is a response to a piece written by Congressmen Andrew Jackson. The piece is formulated around making white people put themselves in the AA slaves shoes. Franklin compares the whites using captured slaves for labor to Muslims capturing white's in the middle east to  use them as slaves. Franklin says that white people view themselves as superior to all other races, and their evidence is their bible. Well the Muslims also view themselves as superior because of the Koran. He compares the whites to Muslims to try to offended them by saying they are just as bad as the Muslims. This piece is extremely clever and witty, just like most of Franklin's pieces. It is interesting how he was able to find a comparison to another religion who views themselves as also superior who is doing the same thing, and justifies it just like the whites at this time do. Franklins work was very impactful at this time, and was a supporting part in the war against slavery.

She was educated in many subjects such as Latin, Greek, Theology and English. Wheatley then began writing poetry and published her first poem at the age of twelve in her first volume of poetry, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral.

They only agreed to publish her poems that were written in honor of famous people in newspapers. To promote her poems and to attempt to get more of them published Wheatley traveled to London.  She became very successful and well known for her poetry in England. Wheatleyâ€™s poems had religious themes and supported the idea spiritual equality.  Her poems were often written in honor of famous figures such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as well. Wheatley wrote a poem about George Washington and sent it to him. He then requested to meet with her in Cambridge.  Wheatley also was able to meet Benjamin Franklin to discuss their similar patriotic views and opposition to John and Nathanial Wheatleyâ€™s loyalist views. Phillis Wheatley died in 1784 at the age of 31. At the time of her death Wheatley was working on another volume of poems all dedicated to Benjamin Franklin; however the documents were lost and never recovered.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Samson Occom]]></title><description><![CDATA[Samson Occom was born into the Mohegan tribe in 1723, and he is believed to be a direct descendant of Uncas, the famous Mohegan chief. Occom comes into Christianity around the age of 16 or 17, during the Great Awakening. Although our book cites Wheatley's letter to him in 1774, she first sent him a letter in 1765, when she was 11 years old. The two became friends, probably because they had much in common. Occom was promised equal pay throughout his life as a preacher, but was never granted it. Occom visited England to promote a school for Native Americans, and, upon his return, realized that his school moved to New Hampshire and all the money he raised was now funding Dartmouth College instead. Moreover, the manuscript Occom wrote following the experience, "A Short Narrative of My Life," now rests at Dartmouth College! Occom spent much of his life impoverished trying to spread Christianity.
        
Take a look at the first minute or so of the video I posted. It's funny how Occom's legacy is portrayed. Some sources cite him as an essential founder of Dartmouth, while others wouldn't go that far. It makes you wonder what Occom really envisioned would happen with all the money he raised by giving 300-400 sermons in England in just over a year.

Likewise, it's also interesting to look at portraits of Occom. Some portraits paint him as if he's very Anglo, others paint him much more like a Native American. These images, too, make me wonder.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=kR_b459xmbU</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >kR_b459xmbU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 1 Jul 1723 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><georss:point>41.3541, -72.1010</georss:point></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA[Elizabeth Ashbridge]]></title><description><![CDATA[Elizabeth Ashbridge was born in 1713 in England.  Her parents were both strict Anglecicans. At age 14 , Elizabeth eloped with a man who ended up just month into their marriage. Elizabeth then lived in Ireland for a few years, until she migrated to the colonies as an indentured servant. The time spent in the colonies are what give us her works and accounts of her experiences. 
        
Ashbridge was known for her progressive views of gender roles and different religious view. Ashbridge is especially know for her "Quaker" views. Ashbridge embraced this life of internal peace and happiness. What makes this interesting is that Ashbridge's previous lifestyle was that of sin and she somehow was able to bring herself to this new way of life. Although Ashbridge embraced this lifestyle she didn't truly find her peace it until after the death of her last husband. 

One of Ashridge's greatest works was called "Some Account of the Fore Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge". This account takes us from her early days of growing up in England to the death of her latest husband. Througout the story, we are really focusing on the relationship between Ashbridge and her husband. Her husband does not support her in her religious beliefs. I think that her husbands biggest problem is seeing that Ashbridge had authority in the church and was able to be a leader. There is a moment in the story where her husband completely turns against her and doesn't even help her when she is freezing cold. At, the end of the story Ashbridge's husband drunkly enlists in the English army and ends up dying of unknown causes. In the end Ashbridge is able to finally embrace her religion and have inner-peace.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Benjamin Franklin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Benjamin Franklin was one of the most important men of science during the Age of Enlightenment in the United States. Instead of blaming magic or some religious cause, he looked for reason in everything that happened in the world around him. Franklin was born in Boston in 1706. He first began at twelve years old by working as an apprentice at his brotherâ€™s printer shop. Franklin was very intelligent and wanted to write for The New England Courant, but his brother would not allow him to be a part of the paper. He started secretly writing letters that he would sneak under the print shop door at night. These letters were written by â€œSilence Dogoodâ€ a fictional woman he created. She gave advice and was critical of the world around her and was very concerned about how women were treated in society. This shows that even at a young age, Franklin was ahead of his time. No one was thinking about how women were treated or their rights during this time period. He looked for a reasonable, scientific explanation for everything and criticized those who tried to use things such as magic and witchcraft as explanations for bad things happening. In his â€œA Witch Trial at Mount Hollyâ€, he describes the events that happened there as comical. He believed the tests the Puritans implemented were through religion, yet did not completely abandon religion. He considered himself to be a Deist, a person who believes in one god but does not believe in supernatural ideas such as miracles, ridiculous and completely unreasonable. He knew there was no way a human being could not outweigh a Bible, a book, and criticized the people in attendance for being surprised that it happened every time and it must be magic. Franklin criticized and doubted most beliefs salvation, and hell. However, Franklin strongly believed that religion helps shape morals in people.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Mary Rowlandson]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mary Rowlandson was said to have been born  in 1637. Her family emigrated to New England and settled in Lancanster, Massachusetts, where she married Reverend Joseph Rowlandson. In 1676, her house was attacked by Native Americans as a result of King Philip's War. The war was caused by settlers breaking treaties and encroaching on Native American land. Ironically, her husband was away at Boston asking for protection for the town while Lancaster was being attacked. Mary and her children were taken captive. Her sewing skills helped her stay alive during this time because she proved beneficial to her captors. She was ransomed and returned to Lancaster three months later. In 1682, she wrote a narrative describing her experience within the Native American tribe. This became one of the first bestsellers in American history and ushered in the captivity genre of books. Mary Rowlandson died in 1691 at the age of seventy three, outliving both of her husbands. The video attached shows scenes of Lancaster, Massachusetts with a voice over by  Mark Blaauw-Hara. It describes the purpose of Mary's narrative and how she used theodicy in order to influence the Puritan community and bring people to God.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=_nQjn_h7JFU</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >_nQjn_h7JFU</guid><pubDate>Wed, 1 Jul 1676 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><georss:point>42.037302,-71.683502</georss:point></item>

In 1675, he, among other Pueblos, was arrested for witchcraft and for killing several Spanish missionaries. He was beaten and treated cruelly by the Spanish. After his release from prison, he went to the Taos Pueblo and planned a revolt on the Spanish because they were stifling the Pueblo culture. This revolt became known as the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. It was successful as the Pueblos and other Indians such as the Zuni and Hopi joined forces and forced the Spanish to retreat to what is now known as El Paso, Texas. PopÃ© hoped that the revolt would restore the Pueblo way of life. He stepped down as leader in 1691 and was said to have died in 1692 just before the Spanish reconquest of New Mexico.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=acq91aPFHPI</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >acq91aPFHPI</guid><pubDate>Mon, 1 Jul 1675 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate></item>

She became famous during her teenage years for her poetry and scholarly writings. She decided to become a nun in 1667 so she could study at her leisure. After taking her vows into the nun-hood, she wrote controversial poetry and plays that challenged social class and values. She became known as one of the earliest feminists, and was credited as the first published feminist of the New World. She was well- known for her work "Respuesta a Sor Filotea", which highlights women's rights to educational access and personal identity. She stood behind the idea that every woman has the right to gain knowledge. Sor Juana famously exclaimed that "one can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper". She was not only a supporter of female education, but a prodigy of secular study.  Sor Juana died in Mexico City, Mexico, on April 17, 1695. She died after ministering a ceremony to other nuns that had been stricken by a plague. 
        
To this day, Sor Juana appears on Mexican currency and her legacy lives as one of the most memorable cultural images in Mexican history. ]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=7hKy1iiQ8lE</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >7hKy1iiQ8lE</guid><pubDate>Sat, 1 Jul 1651 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate></item>

Not much is known about the beginning of his life. He was a general in the pueblo revolts. The most known fact about De Vargas is that he was appointed governor of the New Mexico area in 1691. Vargas took over at a time when few Christian colonists were still living in the area. On September 14, 1692, he reclaimed lost land, better known as the Plaza of Santa Fe.

In April of 1607, the explorers, one of which was a man by the name of John Smith, reached their destination. About a month later, on May 24, they discovered Jamestown, which became known as the first British settlement belonging to North America. Smith, being the leader of this newly established colony, led people on
adventures, and accompanied them on their hunts for food. However, during one of these adventures, he was captured and threatened by the Algonquin Chief, Powhatan. This is the picture that many people have in their heads, and where Pocahontas, supposedly, enters. Though we have no proof that this is true, it has been said that Pocahontas save John Smith from being killed. In 1608, John Smith started an uprising with the Algonquin peoples due to a lack of food. The next year, he was badly injured and forced to return to England. Shortly after, he discovered "New England." John Smith
came in contact with Pocahontas again in 1616 as she was traveling with her husband and son. She was thought to have died in her early 20s due to the smallpox virus or tuberculosis, while John Smith passed away in 1631 at about the age of 51.

During his governorship, in 1598 he led 400 men across the Rio Grande in search for the "seven cities of Cibola". It was a one year expedition that led to a 3 day battle where many of his man and many natives were killed. After that, he sent out many smaller parties in all different directions looking for treasure. In June of 1604 he went out on his last expedition in search of gold. Juan de OÃ±ate and his 30 men went to the Colorado River and the Gulf of California but still found no gold. In 1607 he resigned from governor. He died in 1630.
 The video posted is Indians revealing their feelings for OÃ±ate. The speaker in the video talks about better years to come. I found the video interesting due to what some of the signs say and what happens in the end.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Pocahontas (Rebecca Rolfe)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Matoaka was born in 1595, to the great chief of the Powhatan Chiefdom, Wahunsenaca, and an unknown mother who has been theorized by historians to have passed away during childbirth. Matoaka received the nickname â€œPocahontasâ€ which translated to â€œplayful oneâ€, due to her inquisitive nature and spirited attitude. Pocahontas lived in a Chiefdom with a population of about 25,000 which contained over 30 Algonquian, a family of North American Indian languages, speaking tribes in their homeland of â€œTsenacomocoâ€. 
        
Pocahontas first came in contact with the English in May of 1607, when they arrived in Virginia. Her first encounter with the English was during the period of time that Captain John Smith was captured by her tribesmen. Smith survived the internment and was noted in several published accounts to have developed a friendship with Pocahontas and her homeland tribesmen. Pocahontas, accompanied by her trusted tribesmen, became an emissary for the Powhatan and conducted many trades with the English at the Jamestown settlement. After a year of hostilities and conflict between the English and Pocahontasâ€™s people, her visits to Jamestown were unable to occur any further. In 1609, John Smith returned to England when he was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion. Pocahontas was informed that John Smith had passed away.

In 1610, Pocahontas married Kocoum, a Pamunkey man. They became established in the Potomac region. In 1613, Pocahontas was taken captive and shipped back to Jamestown. The English settlers demanded items that had been stolen from them to be returned and for an abundance of corn. Pocahontas served as the peace treaty between the English and Powhatan tribe.  In 1613, Pocahontas met her soon to be husband, John Rolfe. After returning to the Powhatan village with the Englishmen who were demanding the other half of their ransom, Pocahontas asked for consent from her father to marry John Rolfe. Powhatan blessed his daughterâ€™s marriage, which was viewed as the peace-making matrimony on April 5th of that year. In 1614, Pocahontas decided to convert over to Christianity and change her name to Rebecca. 

Rebecca Rolfe, also known as Pocahontas, gave birth to a healthy son named Thomas, in which they traveled to England two years later. Pocahontas was photographed in Elizabethan styled clothing, which was a large change from her original attire. While in England, she reunited with John Smith after finding out that he is still alive. This was the last meeting between Pocahontas and John Smith. The Rolfe family decided to trek back to Virginia in 1617. Soon after this decision, Pocahontas became too ill to accompany her family in the voyage. At the age of twenty-two, Pocahontas is theorized to have died from tuberculosis or pneumonia. The true illness that she contracted is unknown to this day. She was buried in a graveyard in Gravesend, England.

To this day, Pocahontas is known for her bravery and dynamic role in the existence of the early colony. Pocahontas is one of the most well-known women of early American history. Although her life was cut short by disease, Pocahontas made an impact for many centuries after her lifetime that changed history as we know it.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Anne Hutchinson]]></title><description><![CDATA[As discussed in class, Puritan women were held to strict and oppressive standards of conduct. Puritan women were directed to obey the word of God and of her male superiors. As a Puritan woman living in the Massachusettsâ€™s Bay Colony during the early seventeenth century, Anne Hutchinson was expected to follow the strict social order put in place by the colonyâ€™s Puritan Clergy. The clergy not only ran the religious affairs of the colony, but doubled as the governing body of the colony. In November of 1637, Hutchinson was put on trial for heresy. John Winthrop, governor of the colony at this time, persecuted Hutchinson for running religious bible meeting out of her home. By holding these assemblies in her home and outside of the clergy authority, Winthrop viewed Hutchinson as a threat to the clergy and in clear violation of Puritan beliefs/practices. Hutchinson proposed that people need not listen to the word of ministers and instead hold conversation with God on an individualistic basis outside of the teachings put forward by the church/clergy. Due to the threat Hutchinson posed to the authority of the colonial church she was exiled from the Massachusettsâ€™s Bay Colony. 
        
Side Note: In 1987, Hutchinson was pardoned from her crimes on judicial record.

The YouTube link is a segment from a PBS Documentary directed by David Belton that re-enacts the Anne Hutchinson Trial 
that took place in November of 1637 with presiding Governor, John Winthrop, of the Massachusettsâ€™s Bay Colony as her persecutor/accuser.

In this book he discusses the Indians, Puritans, and the Separatists. Thomas Morton came to America in 1622. After two years of being there, in 1624 he helped establish a new colony called Mount Wollaston, which was named after the captain that he came to America with. In 1626, many of the people from this colony left to find a better environment to live. Morton did not want to leave so he stayed behind and set up a trading post that he renamed Mare Mount or Merrymount. In Merrymount he put up a maypole, which is a tall wooden pole that is used is European cultures. Mortonâ€™s maypole angered many neighboring colonies, which included Separatist Puritans and he was arrested in 1628 and was sent to England. He came back to America in 1629, where he fought the charges that were placed against him. He then again returned to England and worked with Anti-Puritan authorities. Then he came back to American once more in 1643 and was put into prison again in 1644. He died in Maine two years later.

Juan de ZumÃ¡rraga was the first bishop of Mexico and did not believe that she had appeared to Juan Diego. So the Virgin appeared to Juan Diego again and told him to go see the bishop again, and when Juan Diego did so, the Bishop asked him for proof. The Virgin appeared a third time to Juan Diego who wanted him to come back the next day. Finally the Virgin appeared a fourth time to Juan Diego on December 12th, 1531 and told Juan Diego to go and get some roses for her. He got the flowers and wrapped them up because it was winter time. Juan Diego took the flowers to the bishop and an image of the Virgin was on the roses. This was the bishops proof.
        
The Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego multiple times on Tepeyac Hill, bringing together the Aztec and the Spanish conquerors. She is now a very important symbol in the Mexican culture.

Many people believe that More got his ideas from the Mayan and Incan cultures in the mind of Raphael Hythloday, the main character. <i>Utopia</i>, in itself, kind of explains this fantasy of an ideal society. For example, the Europeans would go as far as to declare war on the native Americans if they thought the land was being wasted. They wanted to take over this land, and put it to "better" use with something like agriculture. This is
also know as <b>vacuum domicilium</b>, a term we have come to discover in this
class. Vacuum domicilium helps Europeans to discover the "perfect" colonial utopia in America, what More was attempting to describe in this text.

Here is one of the sites I used when research this topic.

I also used some of the things from our book and from Dr. Beshero-Bondar from class.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Bartolome de las Casas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las Casas was born in Seville, and his father sailed Columbusâ€™s second expedition to the New World. Bartolome seen what Columbus brought back both times (metals, foods, etc.), and that is what he wanted to do. At the age of 18, Las Casas set sail for Hispaniola as a soldier. Upon reaching Hispaniola, he was granted land and one hundred native slave laborers. I want to point out here that Las Casas was a willing participant in these harsh acts towards the Indians before he even set sail for Hispaniola. However, after witnessing a bloody conflict between the Natives and the Spanish, known as the conflict of Cuba, his view changed. He then became a priest and advocated for the Indians. He wrote many journals of the accounts he had. One of his best known journals is the one in our book, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. He said that the treatment and killings of the Indians were against the church, and tried to save the rest of the Indians. Las Casas had many experiments in which he wanted the Indians and Spanish to live together, and show that the Indians were peaceful. However, many things delayed this process and by then, the tensions between these groups were too much to overcome.  After many years of exploring and advocating, Las Casas died in 1566 in Madrid. 
        
This video is a reading of one of his journals, talking about one of
Christopher Columbus' voyages and what he saw, as a
supplement to what we read in the textbook (Heath Anthology of American Literature), with some good visual aids.
