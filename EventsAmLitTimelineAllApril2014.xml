Malotki's research on the Hopi and Native American rock art.) Ekkehart Malotki (1936 - present) is best known for his work with the Hopi tribes. During his time at the Northern Univeristy of Arizona he debunked the myth that Hopi people were unaware of the concept of time and did not discuss it. Through one on one conversations, old cliff drawings, and observations he proved that in fact the Hopi did understand time, just as he hypothesised. It is part of a human nature to understand time. He was also able to translate their language fully into English which no one was able to completely do before him. Dr. Malotki wrote two main books on his findings entitled; Hopi time, and Hopi dictionary along; along with many children's books he learned about Hopi myth and tradition. He taught German, Latin, and Hopi from 1997 - 2004, and as professor emeritus, he's still writing and publishing in the past few years on the Hopi.

It was only intended for visual study of the recording and could not play back sound.  Many of scientists attempted to create a device where they could capture and keep recorded sound, but none were successful until 1887, when inventor Emile Berliner photoengraved a phonautograph recording into metal and played the recording back. 

In 1878, Thomas Edison perfected the phonograph, which was a device with a cylinder covered with an impressionable material such as tin foil, lead, or wax on which a stylus etched grooves. The depth of the grooves made by the stylus corresponded to change in air pressure created by the original sound. The recording could be played back by tracing a needle through the groove and amplifying the vibrations. 

Electrical recording began in 1925 and the recording process drastically improved the quality of the recording process of disc records.  Electrically powered phonographs were introduced and sold in 1930, but electronic reproduction did not become common until the late 1930’s.

Melville backdated the setting of this novella to 1799. Captain Delano sees a strange ship off the coast of Chile. Looking closer, Captain Delano sees the ship, Saint Dominick, is full of blacks. On this ship is where he sees Benito Cereno. Cereno and Delano begin to speak of the horrible conditions of the boat. The blacks on this ship have the same rights as the whites, and Delano sees different fights between the people on the ship. Delano eventually figures out that the blacks are in charge on the Saint Dominick. Babo, a black slave, leads the rebellion and tries to kill Delano. At the end of the story, Babo is killed and Benito Cereno dies as well.

The photo is of two men playing Benito Cereno and Babo in the play Benito Cereno. This play was a retelling of the famous novella, held at the Flea Theater in New York’s Manhattan Tribeca in 2011.

It is a story about a lawyer who hires a quiet, antisocial man named Bartleby to be a scrivener in his office. Bartleby works well at first, and then gradually refuses to do anything the narrator asks him. He does this by using the famous saying "I prefer not too." It is then revealed that Bartleby is living in his office. Instead of firing him, the narrator moves his practice to another building. The people who run the new practice that replaces the narrator's practice finds Bartleby still living in his old office. They complain to the narrator, who still refuses to do anything. Eventually they call the police and Bartleby is sent to jail, where he prefers not to eat. The narrator visits Bartleby but cannot reach him. The story ends with Bartleby starving to death and the narrator finding out that he used to work in the dead letter office. This narrator in this story is obtuse because he could not understand why Bartleby was behaving the way he was. Being a lawyer, all he knew were the ways of wall street and rich people. Bartleby's passive resistance had a huge effect on the narrator as well as other workers in the office. Throughout the story, Bartleby teaches the narrator to have a sense of empathy, a trait which Melville thinks all of humanity should posses as shown in the ending ling "Ah Bartleby! Ah Humanity! The video provides an analysis of the major themes within the story.<br/><small><a href="http://www.shmoop.com/bartleby-the-scrivener/summary.html" title="&quot;Bartleby the Scrivener&quot;" class="meta" target="_blank" >http://www.shmoop.com/bartleby-the-scrivener/summary.html</a></small></p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('zkPOKQqGHks'); return false;" title="Fugitive Slave Acts: 1793 and 1850" >Fugitive Slave Acts: 1793 and 1850</a><br/><small>Sep 18, 1850</small><p>In researching the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, I was surprised to learn that there was an original Fugitive Slave Act, from 1793. The original law was loosely upheld, though. Slaves and abolitionists used the Underground Railroad to circumvent the law. And in a major case in Pennsylvania, in 1842, the court ruled that states were not required to adhere the the original Slave Act.

In 1850, the country being divided as it was, Henry Clay set out to preserve the Union. He drafted the Compromise of 1850, which included The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. There were other points in the compromise, including land property matters. The new Fugitive Slave Act required citizens to assist in the capture of slaves, and slaves were not allowed a jury trial. Slave "hunters" were allowed to find and capture escaped slaves. And because the slaves were denied the proper trial, free African-Americans were forced into slavery, as well.</p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('j4TQzviSk_s'); return false;" title="&quot;Annabel Lee&quot; " >"Annabel Lee" </a><br/><small>1849</small><p>“Annabel Lee” is the last complete poem written by Edgar Allan Poe. The poem was not published until after Poe died in 1849. The poem is a great example of a gothic 
piece with the common theme of death. In the poem, the narrator describes the love he has for Annabel, which started at a very young age. When his beloved Annabel dies, he is devastated but still believes that their souls are intertwined because their love is so strong. He lies beside her dead body in her tomb by the sea. This shows a breaking of the barrier between the living and dead worlds. The poem incorporates the idea of necrophilia because the narrator is still in love with his wife’s dead body. He is clinging to Annabel and the past in a very obsessive way. He is unable to move on and let go of the past. He would rather sleep with a decomposing dead body than let her go. It may seem sweet that the narrator is so in love with his wife that he cannot bear to let her go, but laying in a tomb with her dead body is extremely obsessive and border- line insanity. It is unknown who the inspiration for the poem was, if there even was one at all. Many biographers believe that Poe’s wife, Virginia, was the inspiration because he loved her as a child and had died two years prior to the poem being written. Other 
possible inspirations include Poe’s mother and foster mother, Frances Sargent Osgood, and other women who claim be the inspiration.

He did not receive this position.
However, in 1839 Melville accepted a position to travel as a crew member on a merchant ship called the St. Lawrence. This was Melville's first sea voyage. His second sea voyage would not turn out so successful as he was captured by cannibals on the island of Nukahiva. After four months, he was saved by an Australian vessel and finally reached New York. Much different experiences than his safe New York based character, Bartleby the scrivener.

Garrison was at the forefront of a radical abolition movement that promoted civil equality among blacks and whites. Early in his life he was among the ‘abolitionist’ of the American Colonization Society that favored the return of slaves to Africa. Garrison realized around 1830 that the American Colonization Company’s “true objective was to minimize the amount of free slaves in the United States” not true abolition (http://www.biography.com/people/william-lloyd-garrison-9307251?page=1). Although a radical in comparison to early ‘abolitionist’, Garrison would prove to fall short in later years as the call for abolition grew more radical. Garrison had a strong distaste for direct political action and favored pacifism behind the facade of his newspaper. However, Garrison was an early encourager of Frederick Douglass and did live to see the passing of the 13th amendment (outlawing slavery).

This video is a portion from the PBS special titled “The Abolitionists” that premiered on January 8th, 2013. “The Abolitionists” was produced as a special segment of the larger PBS series “American Experience.” This clip illustrates Garrison’s encouragement for Douglass to publically join the abolitionist movement.

Interesting journal article that addresses the importance of Garrison’s use of rhetoric in the publishing of Douglass’s narrative:

Dickinson  was an American Poet and has written over 1800 poems. What makes Dickinson's poems special are that they are unconventional for their time. A lot of her poems deal with Transcendentalism. This concept is dealing with people becoming filled with knowledge and understanding how the world works. Dickinson is also interesting for her "Slant-Ryhme" and interchangeable lines. Instead of crossing out her work, she would reference the writer to alternate lines. This can change the poem a bit and lets the reader see the poets thinking process while writing. Dickinson continued to write unconventional works throughout her life but only a few were published , and edited at that. Her works didn't go fully public until after her death in 1886 were American's more modern ideals let them appreciate her works. </p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('IJEnBtZCZdg'); return false;" title="Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson" >Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson</a><br/><small>1830 to 1913</small><p>Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson is somewhat of a controversial figure in Emily Dickinson's life. The two became close friends in 1850, which was the same year that Dickinson's brother began courting Susan. Our book mentions the ambiguous relationship the two women had, but nothing can be proved as to how intimate their relationship was. We do know that Susan received over 300 letters from Emily and more than 250 poems. We also know that Emily claimed to have learned more from Susan than any other person, save Shakespeare. Something our book doesn't mention: upon Emily's death, her sister, Lavinia, first asked Susan to edit the poems for publication. Lavinia did not have the patience for Susan's methodical pace, however, and then asked Mabel Loomis Todd and Thomas Wentworth Higginson to edit the work. A curious choice seeing as how Mabel Loomis Todd and Austin Dickinson had been in the middle of a thirteen-year affair, starting in 1882!<br/><small><a href="http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/" title="Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson" class="meta" target="_blank" >http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/</a></small></p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('AMydRKPgoWg'); return false;" title="Emily Dickison" >Emily Dickison</a><br/><small>1830 to 1886</small><p>Born in amherst massachuttess, emily dickinson was one of the greatest american poets. Though she was born into a succesful family, dickinson lived a very secluded life where she did not interact with many people. Her style of writing was very unique, her poems lacked titles, and she used slant words or rhymes. However what made them more unique was that most of her poems  themed about pain, suffering and death. Her type of writing was very dark and differed from most poetry. Dicksons work did not become aparent until after her death in 1886 when her family found most of her poems and published her first collection in 1890. <br/><small><a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/155" title="Emily Dickison" class="meta" target="_blank" >http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/155</a></small></p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('sYIkNzYNiHg'); return false;" title="&quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;" >"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"</a><br/><small>1820</small><p>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was published by Washington Irving in 1820. It is a part of a collection called The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon. It is the most famous story from the collection. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow tells the story of Ichabd Crane. He is a greedy, superstitious school teacher who tries to win over Katrina Von Tassel so he can get his hands on her family's wealth. He competes with Brom Bones, a strong prankster who is also in love with Katrina. One night, Katrina rejects Ichabod at a party at the Van Tassels'. On his way home from the party, he is stalked by what he thinks is the Headless Horseman, the ghost of a Hessian soldier whose head was knocked off by a cannonball during the Revolutionary War. Just when Ichabod thinks he escaped, the Headless Horseman throws his head at him and knocks him off his horse. The next day, Ichabod has disappeared and all that is left at the scene is his hat and a smashed pumpkin. This allows Brom to marry Karina and the townspeople to question whether the Headless Horseman spirited Ichabod away or not. Some believe he simply moved to a different town and became a judge, but the legend lives on. This story is part of the Romanticism movement because it uses elements of ghost stories in sleepy towns and displays Ichabod's sense of confusion and irrationality when it comes to the Headless Horseman. The 
Headless Horsemen itself is a connection to the Revolutionary War, a past event in America's history. This story is also a social satire because it makes fun of Ichabod's superstitious nature even though he is educated. Is also makes fun of Ichabod because he is inferior to Brom Bones even though he is supposedly smarter.<br/><small><a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/the-legend-of-sleepy-hollow/study-guide/about/" title="&quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;" class="meta" target="_blank" >http://www.gradesaver.com/the-legend-of-sleepy-hollow/study-guide/about/</a></small></p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('yeSvLDkDq3w'); return false;" title="Walt Whitman" >Walt Whitman</a><br/><small>Jul 1, 1819</small><p>Walt Whitman was an American poet. Some say he single handled revolutionized American poetry. Alot of people would not even think to write about some of the topics he would entertain. He had very strong ideas about women's rights, slavery, and immigration. In 1848 Whitman began Leaves of Grass. These poems grew and grew to over 300+ poems. These poems were unconventional and challenged American ideals of the time. Whitman then went on to move to Washington D.C. to help his wounded brother who fought in the Civil War. Whitman talked to many soldiers and from those accounts he wrote a collection of poems called "Drum taps". This was one of the only two recordings of the Civil War written by people who actually experienced it. After that, Whitman went on to write two more collections of poems. Whitman then died in March 26 in 1892. Without Whitman literature in America would not be the same without him "busting down the doors" of censorship. </p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('M9xXfEa0yfE'); return false;" title="Iglulik" >Iglulik</a><br/><small>1819 to 1822</small><p>I would like to make clear that this is not an exact date, but it is generally agreed upon that sometime around here in the early 19th century, the Iglulik (also Igloolik) Eskimo-Inuit people were first contacted by Europeans -- British sailors wintered there. By the late 19th/early 20th century Scottish whalers would winter in Iglulik. In the 1920s, contact with missionaries and traders increased to change the society. In 1822, the community is estimated to have a population around 500; now the population is close to 1600. The area has been inhabited for 4,000 years and is rooted with a deep oral tradition similar to the other surrounding tribes.

It was included in the collection of stories called The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon. The story tells the tale of a man named Rip Van Winkle living in a small, simple town in pre-Revolutionary War America. He decides to climb up the Kaatskill Mountain with his dog to escape his nagging wife. While on the mountain, he hears his name being called by Hennrick Hudson and his friends. Although Rip does not know the men, he drinks alcohol with him, becomes drunk and then falls asleep. he wakes up twenty years later to find his dog gone, his rifle rusty, and his bread a foot long. When Rip descends the mountain, he finds his village to be very different. The people are all dressed strangely and the picture of King George in the inn is now replaced with a portrait of George Washington. The people in the village are all on their way to vote. The villagers are weary of because he comes to election with a gun in hand. When asked who he will be voting for, Rip answers that he is loyal to the King, completely unaware that the Revolutionary War has occurred. The people are outraged and accuse Rip of being a tory. When Rip explains who he is and what has happened to him, the villagers feel remorse for him. He then moves in with his grown daughter and enjoys life without his nagging wife. The story of Rip Van Winkle is an example of Romanticism, which Irving brought back from England. Rip experiences rapid change when he falls asleep in a static, stable village, to when he awakens and an new patriotic town. There is a strong sense of patriotism and freedom in the new American town. Rip is surprised and confused by the immense, seemingly rapid changes.

His work however is considered to be very controversial especially his poetry collection called Leaves of Grass. This collection of poetry is considered controversial because of the sexuality that is brought about throughout the poetry. Because of the amount of sexuality controversy over his poetry, Whitman’s sexuality is sometimes questioned and he was often considered to be homosexual or bisexual. Whitman started writing Leaves of Grass in 1850 and he wrote, revised, and rewrote it until he died. In this collection of poetry, Whitman discusses many topics such as American democracy, the body and soul, transcendentalism, realism, the idea of the self or individualism, and sexuality. Besides Leaves of Grass, other works by Whitman include Franklin Evans, Drum-Taps, Memoranda During the War, Specimen Days, and Democratic Vistas. Whitman is also said to be the poet of American democracy and a friend of his Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe, wrote: "You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without Leaves of Grass.” <br/><small><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/" title="Walt Whitman" class="meta" target="_blank" >http://whitmanarchive.org/</a></small></p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('d3w1hXSYl28'); return false;" title="Elizabeth Cady Stanton" >Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a><br/><small>Nov 12, 1815</small><p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton was an important figure in the Women’s Rights Movement. She was an activist and abolitionist for women’s rights in the United States. Her most famous contribution was her Declaration of Sentiments that was presented by her at the Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York in 1848. The Seneca Falls Convention was the first Women’s Rights Convention and this was considered to be the beginning of what would become the Women’s Rights Movement. The Declaration of Sentiments basically stated that all men and women are created equal and 100 people of the 300 people at the convention signed the document. Most of these people that signed it were women, however 32 men signed the document. Stanton wrote or helped write 4 books including History of Woman Suffrage, Solitude of Self, The Woman's Bible, and Eighty Years & More: Reminiscences. Stanton put a lot of hard work into attainting equality for women throughout her lifetime but she passed away 18 years before women would be given the right to vote. <br/><small><a href="http://www.historynet.com/seneca-falls-convention" title="Elizabeth Cady Stanton" class="meta" target="_blank" >http://www.historynet.com/seneca-falls-convention</a></small></p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('9OpAtRtACRE'); return false;" title="Fanny Fern" >Fanny Fern</a><br/><small>Jul 9, 1811 to Oct 10, 1872</small><p>Sara Payson Willis, famously known as “Fanny Fern” was born July 9, 1811 to Deacon Nathaniel Willis and Hannah Parker in Portland, Maine.  Deacon Willis had owned his own Christian newspaper, The Puritan Recorder.  Sara enjoyed growing up in the home of a journalist, but was extremely rebellious of her parent’s religious home environment. At age 16, Sara was sent to Catharine Beecher’s Hartford Female Seminary in New Hampshire, where Beecher’s younger sister, Harriet Beecher [Stowe] had taught for many years. Deacon Willis had sent her here in hopes to curb her rebellious attitude and aid in a sturdy education for his daughter. The seminary was considered the best education for young women in this time period by emphasizing the development of ideas over routine memorization. 

In 1837, Sara married a cashier at the Merchant's Bank of Boston by the name of Charles Harrington Eldredge, in which she gave birth to three daughters: Mary Stace (1838-1845), Grace Harrington (1841-1862), and Ellen Willis (1845-1922). Her oldest daughter, Mary Stace, passed away in 1845 due to brain fever (meningitis).  A year later, Eldredge passed of typhoid fever leaving Sara to financially fend for herself and her two children. In 1846, Sara asked her brother N.P. Willis, a journalist for The New York Home Journal, if he could help her out by publishing some of the material that she had written in desperation, but he rejected her requests. By the persistence of her father, in 1849, Sara married Samuel P. Farrington, a young merchant. Farrington proved to be abusive and resentful, leading to their divorce two years later. 

After the divorce, the writer “Fanny Fern” came to existence to earn support for her family. She chose the name “Fanny Fern” because her warm mother had loved the sweet fern; a sturdy plant that could survive hostile conditions. 

Her first publication, The Model Husband, appeared on June 28, 1851, in Boston's Olive Branch, edited by the Rev. Thomas F. Norris. In the summer of 1852, Fern was hired by the publisher Oliver Dyer at twice her salary to publish a regular column exclusively in his New York newspaper Musical World and Times, making her the first female in history to have her own newspaper column.  In 1853, Dyer had helped her find a publisher for her first two books, Fern Leaves from Fanny's Portfolio (1853) and Little Ferns for Fanny's Little Friends (1853). Her book sold 70,000 copies within the first year.

Weekly columns by "Fanny Fern" appeared in the Boston Olive Branch (28 June 1851 - 25 June), 1853), the Boston True Flag edited by William Moulton (29 November 1851 - 23 April 1853), the New York Musical World and Times published by Oliver Dyer (9 October 1852 - 19 November 1853), and the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post (7 January 1854 - 1 April 1854). All of her popularity had caused her editor, Robert Bonner, to make her the highest paying columnist of her time. 

In 1856, after having a prenuptial agreement drawn up, which gave Fern rights to her earnings before and after her marriage, she married James Parton. Parton was an editor at her brother, N.P. Willis’s newspaper, but quit after Willis refused to publish any of Fanny Fern’s work. 

Fanny Fern died of breast cancer in New York City on October 10, 1872. She was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, alongside her first two daughters and first husband. A large fern-embossed stone cross marks her grave. Fanny Fern will always be remembered for her ambition and determination in becoming and tabloid legend.

During his career there was a riot outside of his office in the streets of Boston about the anti-slavery movement. Phillips was able to calm the riot with an impromptu speech of abolitionist, since that moment he left the practice of law and focused solely on the rights of escaped slaves. People call Phillips the backbone of the abolitionist movement, for although his friend and abolitionist leader William Llyod Harrison was known as the voice of the movement, many of his speeches and written works where co-written by Phillips. Phillips was very dedicated to the abolitionist movement that when he gave up his law firm his family and friends became so concerned that they actual tried to commit him to a psych ward. Yet, nothing could deter Phillips from the cause, he even spoke directly to President Lincoln during the Civil War in an effort to make slavery illegal. Once the cause was seem to be won, Phillips did not step back, he focused his new effort on the feminist movement. Phillips never saw people for the color of skin or their gender, he just saw every person as equal and deserving respect; which is what he dedicated his life to.

Hawthorne was an American writer. His father died when he was four and he was raised by his mother. Hawthorne started at Bowdoin College in 1821. He met many helpful friends during college, such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Franklin Pierce. He did not care much for school and was an average student graduating in 1825. After graduation, Hawthorne spent much time reading and writing. His first novel, Fanshawe, was published in 1828 anonymously. It did not receive much attention. Hawthorne continued to write short stories and one of his college friends convinced him to publish in his own name. In 1837, Twice-Told Tales was published. In 1838, Hawthorne met and fell in love with Sophia Peabody. In 1839, he accepted a position at the Boston Custom House handling salt and coal. In 1841, Hawthorne resigned from his position. In 1842, he married Sophia at her parent’s home in Boston. The couple then moved to Massachusetts and rented the Old Manse from Ralph Emerson. Hawthorne continued to write shortstories for publication. He reissued an edition of Twice-Told Tales in 1842 and published Mosses from an Old Manse in 1846. Income not being very good, the couple moved in with Hawthorne’s mother in Salem in 1845. In 1849, Hawthorne’s mother died and he published his most famous novel, The Scarlet Letter. It was one of the first mass produced books in the United States upon its release in 1850. Hawthorne next wrote The House of the Seven Gables. At that time Herman Melville began writing Moby Dick and dedicated it to Hawthorne.  In 1852, Hawthorne published the critique of Brook Farm, The Blithedale Romance. He also wrote stories for children based on Greek myths. Hawthorne and his family were able to travel and while in Rome, his novel The Marble Faun was published in 1860. Hawthorne’s health began to worsen and he continued t write short stories. In 1864, Hawthorne went on a trip with President Pierce despite his health and died during the night.

She was sold multiple times, and while under ownership of the Dumont family, married another slave of the family, Thomas. Isabella and Thomas had five children together. In 1827, New York had passed a law that emancipated all slaves, but Isabella had already left her husband and fled with her youngest child. 

	She soon became a worker for the Isaac Van Wagenen family. While under employment of the Isaac Van Wagenen family, Isabella heard word that her son had been sold into slavery in Alabama by the Dumont family, in which she sued in court and won ownership of him. 

	Isabella underwent religious conversion and decided to travel to New York to a Methodist perfectionist commune. Shortly after, she was influenced by a religious prophet named Mathias. Under corruption, the commune fell apart. Many were accused of sexual allegations and even murder. Isabella was accused of poisoning and sued for libel and won the case. She continued to work as a household servant.
	In 1843, Isabella adopted the name Sojourner Truth believing that the Holy Spirit placed her on this earth to become a traveling preacher and preach the word of God.  In the late 1840’s, she connected with many abolitionists and became a popular abolitionist speaker.  She continued into the 1850’s to preach about women’s suffrage. In 1851, she gave one of the most famous speeches of her life, “Ain’t I a Woman” at the women’s right convention in Ohio.
	Sojourner Truth met Harriet Beecher Stowe and became a topic of her discussion in the “Atlantic Monthly”.  Stowe went on to write the introduction for Truth’s autobiography, The Narrative of Sojourner Truth.  Sojourner moved to Michigan and became a member of another commune which was associated with the Friends.  She was at one point involved with Millerites, a famous religious movement that grew out of Methodism and later became the Seventh Day Adventists.
	During the Civil War, Truth raised clothing and food contributions for African American troops and went on to meet President Abraham Lincoln at the White House in 1864. While visiting, she challenged segregation and discrimination that segregated street cars by race.
	After the war, Sojourner Truth continued to give speeches advocating for a “Negro State” in the west. She spoke to audiences that were majority white to educate them on religion, "Negro" and women's rights, and temperance. She also attempted to provide jobs for black refugees in the war.
	In 1875, Sojourner Truth’s companion and grandson fell ill and died. Truth returned to Michigan where shortly after her health deteriorated leading to her death in 1883. She passed away in a sanatorium of Battle Creek with infected ulcers in her legs. She was buried in Battle Creek Michigan. Her funeral was marked in history as one of the most attended. 
Sojourner Truth is remembered for her courageous and charitable acts during the civil war for black individuals. She has impacted history with her vocalizations against slavery and global discrimination. She will forever be remembered as one of the most influential speakers and activists of her time.

The was a satirical piece who's purpose was to show the English men that the ways of keeping slaves is immoral. The letter is a response to a piece written by Congressmen Andrew Jackson. The piece is formulated around making white people put themselves in the AA slaves shoes. Franklin compares the whites using captured slaves for labor to Muslims capturing white's in the middle east to  use them as slaves. Franklin says that white people view themselves as superior to all other races, and their evidence is their bible. Well the Muslims also view themselves as superior because of the Koran. He compares the whites to Muslims to try to offended them by saying they are just as bad as the Muslims. This piece is extremely clever and witty, just like most of Franklin's pieces. It is interesting how he was able to find a comparison to another religion who views themselves as also superior who is doing the same thing, and justifies it just like the whites at this time do. Franklins work was very impactful at this time, and was a supporting part in the war against slavery.

Due to the fact that he was born with complications, he traveled to Spain when he was only twenty one because of a lung problem. He published his first novel, "History of New York," under the pseudonym of Diedrich Knickerbocker in 1809. Ten years later, "The Sketch Book" was published under Geoffrey Crayon, which included two of his most famous stories, "Rip Van Winkle" and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." In 1826, he conducted research in Spain for his biography of Christopher Columbus, which was published in 1828. He also wrote "Granada" in 1829 and "Alhambra" in 1832 (about Spain). Between those two years of 1829 and 1932, he became the secretary of the U.S. legation in London. When he was finished with this job, he decided to move back to America where he bought a farm and a small Dutch cottage, which is now known as the famous "Sunnyside" residence. In 1842, he became the U.S. ambassador for Spain, but this ended in 1846. Washington Irving also wrote "Life of George Washington" in 1859.

Wheatley was first purchased to be a house servant for Suzanna Wheatley but when Suzanna noticed her intelligence she decided to educate her instead of training her to be a servant.

Wheatley then began writing poetry and published her first poem at the age of twelve in her first volume of poetry, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral.

They only agreed to publish her poems that were written in honor of famous people in newspapers. To promote her poems and to attempt to get more of them published Wheatley traveled to London.

Her poems were often written in honor of famous figures such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as well. Wheatley wrote a poem about George Washington and sent it to him. He then requested to meet with her in Cambridge.  Wheatley also was able to meet Benjamin Franklin to discuss their similar patriotic views and opposition to John and Nathanial Wheatley’s loyalist views. Phillis Wheatley died in 1784 at the age of 31. At the time of her death Wheatley was working on another volume of poems all dedicated to Benjamin Franklin; however the documents were lost and never recovered.

He had failed out of school and did not exactly now what to do with his life at first. In 1768, he was a tax officer in England. In 1772, he published "The Case of the Officers of Excise" arguing for a pay raise for officers. In 1774, he met Benjamin Franklin in London. Franklin helped him move to Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, Paine’s journalism career began.  In 1776, Paine published one of his most famous works. He published _Common Sense_, which was Paine’s call to arms for America.  He then tried the army, but being a soldier did not work out for him. He next published _The American Crisis_ which inspired the Army. _The American Crisis_ was very popular and was read by many.  Paine then moved to Europe and began working on new inventions. He worked on a smokeless candle and an iron bridge.  In 1791-92 he wrote _The Rights of Man_ due to the French Revolution. This work did not make things good for Paine.  He was labeled an outlaw in England and fled to France to join the National Convention.  He was imprisoned in France in 1793. In prison he produced _The Age of Reason_. He was freed in 1794 and remained in France until he received an invitation from Thomas Jefferson and then he returned to America. He died on June 8, 1809 in New York City. Thomas Paine was an important man. His writings inspired passion and brought some criticism. His views on religion ended his success. He was a writer, a patriot, and a big dreamer. The video tells more about Paine. It was made on the 200th anniversary of his death.

Occom comes into Christianity around the age of 16 or 17, during the Great Awakening. Although our book cites Wheatley's letter to him in 1774, she first sent him a letter in 1765, when she was 11 years old. The two became friends, probably because they had much in common. Occom was promised equal pay throughout his life as a preacher, but was never granted it. Occom visited England to promote a school for Native Americans, and, upon his return, realized that his school moved to New Hampshire and all the money he raised was now funding Dartmouth College instead. Moreover, the manuscript Occom wrote following the experience, "A Short Narrative of My Life," now rests at Dartmouth College! Occom spent much of his life impoverished trying to spread Christianity.

Take a look at the first minute or so of the video I posted. It's funny how Occom's legacy is portrayed. Some sources cite him as an essential founder of Dartmouth, while others wouldn't go that far. It makes you wonder what Occom really envisioned would happen with all the money he raised by giving 300-400 sermons in England in just over a year.

Likewise, it's also interesting to look at portraits of Occom. Some portraits paint him as if he's very Anglo, others paint him much more like a Native American. These images, too, make me wonder.</p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('UZ1LxuSU5VM'); return false;" title="Elizabeth Ashbridge" >Elizabeth Ashbridge</a><br/><small>1713</small><p>Elizabeth Ashbridge was born in 1713 in England.  Her parents were both strict Anglecicans. At age 14 , Elizabeth eloped with a man who ended up just month into their marriage. Elizabeth then lived in Ireland for a few years, until she migrated to the colonies as an indentured servant. The time spent in the colonies are what give us her works and accounts of her experiences. 

Ashbridge was known for her progressive views of gender roles and different religious view. Ashbridge is especially know for her "Quaker" views. Ashbridge embraced this life of internal peace and happiness. What makes this interesting is that Ashbridge's previous lifestyle was that of sin and she somehow was able to bring herself to this new way of life. Although Ashbridge embraced this lifestyle she didn't truly find her peace it until after the death of her last husband. 

One of Ashridge's greatest works was called "Some Account of the Fore Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge". This account takes us from her early days of growing up in England to the death of her latest husband. Througout the story, we are really focusing on the relationship between Ashbridge and her husband. Her husband does not support her in her religious beliefs. I think that her husbands biggest problem is seeing that Ashbridge had authority in the church and was able to be a leader. There is a moment in the story where her husband completely turns against her and doesn't even help her when she is freezing cold. At, the end of the story Ashbridge's husband drunkly enlists in the English army and ends up dying of unknown causes. In the end Ashbridge is able to finally embrace her religion and have inner-peace.

Instead of blaming magic or some religious cause, he looked for reason in everything that happened in the world around him. Franklin was born in Boston in 1706. He first began at twelve years old by working as an apprentice at his brother’s printer shop. Franklin was very intelligent and wanted to write for The New England Courant, but his brother would not allow him to be a part of the paper. He started secretly writing letters that he would sneak under the print shop door at night. These letters were written by “Silence Dogood” a fictional woman he created. She gave advice and was critical of the world around her and was very concerned about how women were treated in society. This shows that even at a young age, Franklin was ahead of his time. No one was thinking about how women were treated or their rights during this time period. He looked for a reasonable, scientific explanation for everything and criticized those who tried to use things such as magic and witchcraft as explanations for bad things happening. In his “A Witch Trial at Mount Holly”, he describes the events that happened there as comical. He believed the tests the Puritans implemented were through religion, yet did not completely abandon religion. He considered himself to be a Deist, a person who believes in one god but does not believe in supernatural ideas such as miracles, ridiculous and completely unreasonable. He knew there was no way a human being could not outweigh a Bible, a book, and criticized the people in attendance for being surprised that it happened every time and it must be magic. Franklin criticized and doubted most beliefs salvation, and hell. However, Franklin strongly believed that religion helps shape morals in people.

Her family emigrated to New England and settled in Lancanster, Massachusetts, where she married Reverend Joseph Rowlandson. In 1676, her house was attacked by Native Americans as a result of King Philip's War. The war was caused by settlers breaking treaties and encroaching on Native American land. Ironically, her husband was away at Boston asking for protection for the town while Lancaster was being attacked. Mary and her children were taken captive. Her sewing skills helped her stay alive during this time because she proved beneficial to her captors. She was ransomed and returned to Lancaster three months later. In 1682, she wrote a narrative describing her experience within the Native American tribe. This became one of the first bestsellers in American history and ushered in the captivity genre of books. Mary Rowlandson died in 1691 at the age of seventy three, outliving both of her husbands. The video attached shows scenes of Lancaster, Massachusetts with a voice over by  Mark Blaauw-Hara.

In 1675, he, among other Pueblos, was arrested for witchcraft and for killing several Spanish missionaries. He was beaten and treated cruelly by the Spanish. After his release from prison, he went to the Taos Pueblo and planned a revolt on the Spanish because they were stifling the Pueblo culture. This revolt became known as the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. It was successful as the Pueblos and other Indians such as the Zuni and Hopi joined forces and forced the Spanish to retreat to what is now known as El Paso, Texas. Popé hoped that the revolt would restore the Pueblo way of life.

She became famous during her teenage years for her poetry and scholarly writings. She decided to become a nun in 1667 so she could study at her leisure. After taking her vows into the nun-hood, she wrote controversial poetry and plays that challenged social class and values. She became known as one of the earliest feminists, and was credited as the first published feminist of the New World. She was well- known for her work "Respuesta a Sor Filotea", which highlights women's rights to educational access and personal identity. She stood behind the idea that every woman has the right to gain knowledge. Sor Juana famously exclaimed that "one can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper". She was not only a supporter of female education, but a prodigy of secular study.  Sor Juana died in Mexico City, Mexico, on April 17, 1695. She died after ministering a ceremony to other nuns that had been stricken by a plague. 

To this day, Sor Juana appears on Mexican currency and her legacy lives as one of the most memorable cultural images in Mexican history. <br/><small><a href="http://www.biography.com/people/sor-juana-in%C3%A9s-de-la-cruz-38178" title="Sor Juana Inés De La Cruz" class="meta" target="_blank" >http://www.biography.com/people/sor-juana-in%C3%A9s-de-la-cruz-38178</a></small></p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('7YHrg7XrCoU'); return false;" title="Diego de Vargas" >Diego de Vargas</a><br/><small>1643 to 1704</small><p>De Vargas’ real name is Diego de Vargas Zapata y Lujan Ponce de Leon y Contreras.

On September 14, 1692, he reclaimed lost land, better known as the Plaza of Santa Fe. Vargas helped rebuild the Spanish empire in the time in was governor.

In April of 1607, the explorers, one of which was a man by the name of John Smith, reached their destination. About a month later, on May 24, they discovered Jamestown, which became known as the first British settlement belonging to North America. Smith, being the leader of this newly established colony, led people on
adventures, and accompanied them on their hunts for food. However, during one of these adventures, he was captured and threatened by the Algonquin Chief, Powhatan. This is the picture that many people have in their heads, and where Pocahontas, supposedly, enters. Though we have no proof that this is true, it has been said that Pocahontas save John Smith from being killed. In 1608, John Smith started an uprising with the Algonquin peoples due to a lack of food. The next year, he was badly injured and forced to return to England. Shortly after, he discovered "New England." John Smith
came in contact with Pocahontas again in 1616 as she was traveling with her husband and son. She was thought to have died in her early 20s due to the smallpox virus or tuberculosis, while John Smith passed away in 1631 at about the age of 51.

During his governorship, in 1598 he led 400 men across the Rio Grande in search for the "seven cities of Cibola". It was a one year expedition that led to a 3 day battle where many of his man and many natives were killed. After that, he sent out many smaller parties in all different directions looking for treasure. In June of 1604 he went out on his last expedition in search of gold. Juan de Oñate and his 30 men went to the Colorado River and the Gulf of California but still found no gold. In 1607 he resigned from governor. He died in 1630.

Matoaka received the nickname “Pocahontas” which translated to “playful one”, due to her inquisitive nature and spirited attitude. Pocahontas lived in a Chiefdom with a population of about 25,000 which contained over 30 Algonquian, a family of North American Indian languages, speaking tribes in their homeland of “Tsenacomoco”. 

Pocahontas first came in contact with the English in May of 1607, when they arrived in Virginia. Her first encounter with the English was during the period of time that Captain John Smith was captured by her tribesmen. Smith survived the internment and was noted in several published accounts to have developed a friendship with Pocahontas and her homeland tribesmen. Pocahontas, accompanied by her trusted tribesmen, became an emissary for the Powhatan and conducted many trades with the English at the Jamestown settlement. After a year of hostilities and conflict between the English and Pocahontas’s people, her visits to Jamestown were unable to occur any further. In 1609, John Smith returned to England when he was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion. Pocahontas was informed that John Smith had passed away.

In 1610, Pocahontas married Kocoum, a Pamunkey man. They became established in the Potomac region. In 1613, Pocahontas was taken captive and shipped back to Jamestown. The English settlers demanded items that had been stolen from them to be returned and for an abundance of corn. Pocahontas served as the peace treaty between the English and Powhatan tribe.  In 1613, Pocahontas met her soon to be husband, John Rolfe. After returning to the Powhatan village with the Englishmen who were demanding the other half of their ransom, Pocahontas asked for consent from her father to marry John Rolfe. Powhatan blessed his daughter’s marriage, which was viewed as the peace-making matrimony on April 5th of that year. In 1614, Pocahontas decided to convert over to Christianity and change her name to Rebecca. 

Rebecca Rolfe, also known as Pocahontas, gave birth to a healthy son named Thomas, in which they traveled to England two years later. Pocahontas was photographed in Elizabethan styled clothing, which was a large change from her original attire. While in England, she reunited with John Smith after finding out that he is still alive. This was the last meeting between Pocahontas and John Smith. The Rolfe family decided to trek back to Virginia in 1617. Soon after this decision, Pocahontas became too ill to accompany her family in the voyage. At the age of twenty-two, Pocahontas is theorized to have died from tuberculosis or pneumonia. The true illness that she contracted is unknown to this day. She was buried in a graveyard in Gravesend, England.

To this day, Pocahontas is known for her bravery and dynamic role in the existence of the early colony. Pocahontas is one of the most well-known women of early American history. Although her life was cut short by disease, Pocahontas made an impact for many centuries after her lifetime that changed history as we know it.

Puritan women were directed to obey the word of God and of her male superiors. As a Puritan woman living in the Massachusetts’s Bay Colony during the early seventeenth century, Anne Hutchinson was expected to follow the strict social order put in place by the colony’s Puritan Clergy. The clergy not only ran the religious affairs of the colony, but doubled as the governing body of the colony. In November of 1637, Hutchinson was put on trial for heresy. John Winthrop, governor of the colony at this time, persecuted Hutchinson for running religious bible meeting out of her home. By holding these assemblies in her home and outside of the clergy authority, Winthrop viewed Hutchinson as a threat to the clergy and in clear violation of Puritan beliefs/practices. Hutchinson proposed that people need not listen to the word of ministers and instead hold conversation with God on an individualistic basis outside of the teachings put forward by the church/clergy. Due to the threat Hutchinson posed to the authority of the colonial church she was exiled from the Massachusetts’s Bay Colony. 

Side Note: In 1987, Hutchinson was pardoned from her crimes on judicial record.

that took place in November of 1637 with presiding Governor, John Winthrop, of the Massachusetts’s Bay Colony as her persecutor/accuser.

After two years of being there, in 1624 he helped establish a new colony called Mount Wollaston, which was named after the captain that he came to America with. In 1626, many of the people from this colony left to find a better environment to live. Morton did not want to leave so he stayed behind and set up a trading post that he renamed Mare Mount or Merrymount. In Merrymount he put up a maypole, which is a tall wooden pole that is used is European cultures. Morton’s maypole angered many neighboring colonies, which included Separatist Puritans and he was arrested in 1628 and was sent to England. He came back to America in 1629, where he fought the charges that were placed against him. He then again returned to England and worked with Anti-Puritan authorities. Then he came back to American once more in 1643 and was put into prison again in 1644. He died in Maine two years later.

The video attached is a short bibliography of Champlain with more details.<br/><small><a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105187/Samuel-de-Champlain" title="Samuel de Champlain " class="meta" target="_blank" >http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105187/Samuel-de-Champlain</a></small></p></li><li><a href="#" onclick="STLChrome.popup.showEventWithEID('EH3oM_6kqVc'); return false;" title="The Virgin of Guadalupe appears to Juan Diego" >The Virgin of Guadalupe appears to Juan Diego</a><br/><small>Dec 1531</small><p>The Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego and told him that she wanted a church built on Tepeyac Hill and she told him to tell the church authorities. Juan de Zumárraga was the first bishop of Mexico and did not believe that she had appeared to Juan Diego. So the Virgin appeared to Juan Diego again and told him to go see the bishop again, and when Juan Diego did so, the Bishop asked him for proof. The Virgin appeared a third time to Juan Diego who wanted him to come back the next day. Finally the Virgin appeared a fourth time to Juan Diego on December 12th, 1531 and told Juan Diego to go and get some roses for her. He got the flowers and wrapped them up because it was winter time. Juan Diego took the flowers to the bishop and an image of the Virgin was on the roses. This was the bishops proof.

The Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego multiple times on Tepeyac Hill, bringing together the Aztec and the Spanish conquerors. She is now a very important symbol in the Mexican culture.

It is set on an island focusing mainly on communism and paganism, and taken over by reason. This story is said to have come from a person who has traveled to this island, and wants to prove that communism is needed to take away egoism. Utopia has several different subjects included in it, such as societies of different religions and the rights of women.

Many people believe that More got his ideas from the Mayan and Incan cultures in the mind of Raphael Hythloday, the main character. Utopia, in itself, kind of explains this fantasy of an ideal society. For example, the Europeans would go as far as to declare war on the native Americans if they thought the land was being wasted. They wanted to take over this land, and put it to "better" use with something like agriculture. This is
also know as vacuum domicilium, a term we have come to discover in this
class. Vacuum domicilium helps Europeans to discover the "perfect" colonial utopia in America, what More was attempting to describe in this text.

Here is one of the sites I used when research this topic.

I also used some of the things from our book and from Dr. Beshero-Bondar from class.

Bartolome seen what Columbus brought back both times (metals, foods, etc.), and that is what he wanted to do. At the age of 18, Las Casas set sail for Hispaniola as a soldier. Upon reaching Hispaniola, he was granted land and one hundred native slave laborers. I want to point out here that Las Casas was a willing participant in these harsh acts towards the Indians before he even set sail for Hispaniola. However, after witnessing a bloody conflict between the Natives and the Spanish, known as the conflict of Cuba, his view changed. He then became a priest and advocated for the Indians. He wrote many journals of the accounts he had. One of his best known journals is the one in our book, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. He said that the treatment and killings of the Indians were against the church, and tried to save the rest of the Indians. Las Casas had many experiments in which he wanted the Indians and Spanish to live together, and show that the Indians were peaceful. However, many things delayed this process and by then, the tensions between these groups were too much to overcome.  After many years of exploring and advocating, Las Casas died in 1566 in Madrid. 

This video is a reading of one of his journals, talking about one of
Christopher Columbus' voyages and what he saw, as a
supplement to what we read in the textbook (Heath Anthology of American Literature), with some good visual aids.
