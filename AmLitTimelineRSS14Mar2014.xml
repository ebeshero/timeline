    <item><title><![CDATA[Ekkehart Malotki]]></title><description><![CDATA[(The dates we're providing here are for Malotki's research on the Hopi and Native American rock art.) Ekkehart Malotki (1936 - present) is best known for his work with the Hopi tribes. During his time at the Northern Univeristy of Arizona he debunked the myth that Hopi people were unaware of the concept of time and did not discuss it. Through one on one conversations, old cliff drawings, and observations he proved that in fact the Hopi did understand time, just as he hypothesised. It is part of a human nature to understand time. He was also able to translate their language fully into English which no one was able to completely do before him. Dr. Malotki wrote two main books on his findings entitled; Hopi time, and Hopi dictionary along; along with many children's books he learned about Hopi myth and tradition. He taught German, Latin, and Hopi from 1997 - 2004, and as professor emeritus, he's still writing and publishing in the past few years on the Hopi.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Iglulik]]></title><description><![CDATA[I would like to make clear that this is not an exact date, but it is generally agreed upon that sometime around here in the early 19th century, the Iglulik (also Igloolik) Eskimo-Inuit people were first contacted by Europeans -- British sailors wintered there. By the late 19th/early 20th century Scottish whalers would winter in Iglulik. In the 1920s, contact with missionaries and traders increased to change the society. In 1822, the community is estimated to have a population around 500; now the population is close to 1600. The area has been inhabited for 4,000 years and is rooted with a deep oral tradition similar to the other surrounding tribes. I have posted here a video of some Iglulik throat singing; examples of more "normal" singing exist from them, as well.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=M9xXfEa0yfE</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >M9xXfEa0yfE</guid><pubDate>Thu, 1 Jul 1819 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><geo>69.3761, -81.7994</geo></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA[Ben Franklins' On the Slave Trade is published]]></title><description><![CDATA["On the Slave Trade" was a piece written by Benjamin Franklin just 3 weeks before his death. The was a satirical piece who's purpose was to show the English men that the ways of keeping slaves is immoral. The letter is a response to a piece written by Congressmen Andrew Jackson. The piece is formulated around making white people put themselves in the AA slaves shoes. Franklin compares the whites using captured slaves for labor to Muslims capturing white's in the middle east to  use them as slaves. Franklin says that white people view themselves as superior to all other races, and their evidence is their bible. Well the Muslims also view themselves as superior because of the Koran. He compares the whites to Muslims to try to offended them by saying they are just as bad as the Muslims. This piece is extremely clever and witty, just like most of Franklin's pieces. It is interesting how he was able to find a comparison to another religion who views themselves as also superior who is doing the same thing, and justifies it just like the whites at this time do. Franklins work was very impactful at this time, and was a supporting part in the war against slavery.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Phillis Wheatley ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Phillis Wheatley was the first published African American woman. She was born in Gambia, Africa in 1753 and kidnapped by slave traders at the age of seven. She was taken to Boston on a slave ship where she was sold to a wealthy family named the Wheatleys. Suzanna Wheatley named Phillis after the slave ship she was brought to Massachusetts on called The Phillis. Wheatley was first purchased to be a house servant for Suzanna Wheatley but when Suzanna noticed her intelligence she decided to educate her instead of training her to be a servant. She was educated in many subjects such as Latin, Greek, Theology and English. Wheatley then began writing poetry and published her first poem at the age of twelve in her first volume of poetry, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral. Many publishers in Boston refused to publish her poems because of her race, gender and political views. They only agreed to publish her poems that were written in honor of famous people in newspapers. To promote her poems and to attempt to get more of them published Wheatley traveled to London.  She became very successful and well known for her poetry in England. Wheatleyâ€™s poems had religious themes and supported the idea spiritual equality.  Her poems were often written in honor of famous figures such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as well. Wheatley wrote a poem about George Washington and sent it to him. He then requested to meet with her in Cambridge.  Wheatley also was able to meet Benjamin Franklin to discuss their similar patriotic views and opposition to John and Nathanial Wheatleyâ€™s loyalist views. Phillis Wheatley died in 1784 at the age of 31. At the time of her death Wheatley was working on another volume of poems all dedicated to Benjamin Franklin; however the documents were lost and never recovered.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Samson Occom]]></title><description><![CDATA[Samson Occom was born into the Mohegan tribe in 1723, and he is believed to be a direct descendant of Uncas, the famous Mohegan chief. Occom comes into Christianity around the age of 16 or 17, during the Great Awakening. Although our book cites Wheatley's letter to him in 1774, she first sent him a letter in 1765, when she was 11 years old. The two became friends, probably because they had much in common. Occom was promised equal pay throughout his life as a preacher, but was never granted it. Occom visited England to promote a school for Native Americans, and, upon his return, realized that his school moved to New Hampshire and all the money he raised was now funding Dartmouth College instead. Moreover, the manuscript Occom wrote following the experience, "A Short Narrative of My Life," now rests at Dartmouth College! Occom spent much of his life impoverished trying to spread Christianity.
        
Take a look at the first minute or so of the video I posted. It's funny how Occom's legacy is portrayed. Some sources cite him as an essential founder of Dartmouth, while others wouldn't go that far. It makes you wonder what Occom really envisioned would happen with all the money he raised by giving 300-400 sermons in England in just over a year.

Likewise, it's also interesting to look at portraits of Occom. Some portraits paint him as if he's very Anglo, others paint him much more like a Native American. These images, too, make me wonder.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=kR_b459xmbU</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >kR_b459xmbU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 1 Jul 1723 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><geo>41.3541, -72.1010</geo></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA[Elizabeth Ashbridge]]></title><description><![CDATA[Elizabeth Ashbridge was born in 1713 in England.  Her parents were both strict Anglecicans. At age 14 , Elizabeth eloped with a man who ended up just month into their marriage. Elizabeth then lived in Ireland for a few years, until she migrated to the colonies as an indentured servant. The time spent in the colonies are what give us her works and accounts of her experiences. 
        
Ashbridge was known for her progressive views of gender roles and different religious view. Ashbridge is especially know for her "Quaker" views. Ashbridge embraced this life of internal peace and happiness. What makes this interesting is that Ashbridge's previous lifestyle was that of sin and she somehow was able to bring herself to this new way of life. Although Ashbridge embraced this lifestyle she didn't truly find her peace it until after the death of her last husband. 

One of Ashridge's greatest works was called "Some Account of the Fore Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge". This account takes us from her early days of growing up in England to the death of her latest husband. Througout the story, we are really focusing on the relationship between Ashbridge and her husband. Her husband does not support her in her religious beliefs. I think that her husbands biggest problem is seeing that Ashbridge had authority in the church and was able to be a leader. There is a moment in the story where her husband completely turns against her and doesn't even help her when she is freezing cold. At, the end of the story Ashbridge's husband drunkly enlists in the English army and ends up dying of unknown causes. In the end Ashbridge is able to finally embrace her religion and have inner-peace.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Benjamin Franklin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Benjamin Franklin was one of the most important men of science during the Age of Enlightenment in the United States. Instead of blaming magic or some religious cause, he looked for reason in everything that happened in the world around him. Franklin was born in Boston in 1706. He first began at twelve years old by working as an apprentice at his brotherâ€™s printer shop. Franklin was very intelligent and wanted to write for The New England Courant, but his brother would not allow him to be a part of the paper. He started secretly writing letters that he would sneak under the print shop door at night. These letters were written by â€œSilence Dogoodâ€ a fictional woman he created. She gave advice and was critical of the world around her and was very concerned about how women were treated in society. This shows that even at a young age, Franklin was ahead of his time. No one was thinking about how women were treated or their rights during this time period. He looked for a reasonable, scientific explanation for everything and criticized those who tried to use things such as magic and witchcraft as explanations for bad things happening. In his â€œA Witch Trial at Mount Hollyâ€, he describes the events that happened there as comical. He believed the tests the Puritans implemented were through religion, yet did not completely abandon religion. He considered himself to be a Deist, a person who believes in one god but does not believe in supernatural ideas such as miracles, ridiculous and completely unreasonable. He knew there was no way a human being could not outweigh a Bible, a book, and criticized the people in attendance for being surprised that it happened every time and it must be magic. Franklin criticized and doubted most beliefs salvation, and hell. However, Franklin strongly believed that religion helps shape morals in people.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Mary Rowlandson]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mary Rowlandson was said to have been born  in 1637. Her family emigrated to New England and settled in Lancanster, Massachusetts, where she married Reverend Joseph Rowlandson. In 1676, her house was attacked by Native Americans as a result of King Philip's War. The war was caused by settlers breaking treaties and encroaching on Native American land. Ironically, her husband was away at Boston asking for protection for the town while Lancaster was being attacked. Mary and her children were taken captive. Her sewing skills helped her stay alive during this time because she proved beneficial to her captors. She was ransomed and returned to Lancaster three months later. In 1682, she wrote a narrative describing her experience within the Native American tribe. This became one of the first bestsellers in American history and ushered in the captivity genre of books. Mary Rowlandson died in 1691 at the age of seventy three, outliving both of her husbands. The video attached shows scenes of Lancaster, Massachusetts with a voice over by  Mark Blaauw-Hara. It describes the purpose of Mary's narrative and how she used theodicy in order to influence the Puritan community and bring people to God.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=_nQjn_h7JFU</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >_nQjn_h7JFU</guid><pubDate>Wed, 1 Jul 1676 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><geo>42.037302,-71.683502</geo></item>

In 1675, he, among other Pueblos, was arrested for witchcraft and for killing several Spanish missionaries. He was beaten and treated cruelly by the Spanish. After his release from prison, he went to the Taos Pueblo and planned a revolt on the Spanish because they were stifling the Pueblo culture. This revolt became known as the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. It was successful as the Pueblos and other Indians such as the Zuni and Hopi joined forces and forced the Spanish to retreat to what is now known as El Paso, Texas. PopÃ© hoped that the revolt would restore the Pueblo way of life. He stepped down as leader in 1691 and was said to have died in 1692 just before the Spanish reconquest of New Mexico.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=acq91aPFHPI</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >acq91aPFHPI</guid><pubDate>Mon, 1 Jul 1675 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA[Sor Juana InÃ©s De La Cruz]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sor Juana InÃ©s De La Cruz was born in Tepetlixpa, Mexico, in 1651. She became famous during her teenage years for her poetry and scholarly writings. She decided to become a nun in 1667 so she could study at her leisure. After taking her vows into the nun-hood, she wrote controversial poetry and plays that challenged social class and values. She became known as one of the earliest feminists, and was credited as the first published feminist of the New World. She was well- known for her work "Respuesta a Sor Filotea", which highlights women's rights to educational access and personal identity. She stood behind the idea that every woman has the right to gain knowledge. Sor Juana famously exclaimed that "one can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper". She was not only a supporter of female education, but a prodigy of secular study.  Sor Juana died in Mexico City, Mexico, on April 17, 1695. She died after ministering a ceremony to other nuns that had been stricken by a plague. 
        
To this day, Sor Juana appears on Mexican currency and her legacy lives as one of the most memorable cultural images in Mexican history. ]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=7hKy1iiQ8lE</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >7hKy1iiQ8lE</guid><pubDate>Sat, 1 Jul 1651 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate></item>

Not much is known about the beginning of his life. He was a general in the pueblo revolts. The most known fact about De Vargas is that he was appointed governor of the New Mexico area in 1691. Vargas took over at a time when few Christian colonists were still living in the area. On September 14, 1692, he reclaimed lost land, better known as the Plaza of Santa Fe. Vargas helped rebuild the Spanish empire in the time in was governor.  When the French threatened the land, Vargas got weapons, and crushed a rebellion by the pueblos.  He wrote many letters of his conquests, such as the one in our text.

However many did not believe that it was her own work because women were thought not to be able to write this good. Any women who would use her wit would be ridiculed by the community.

During his governorship, in 1598 he led 400 men across the Rio Grande in search for the "seven cities of Cibola". It was a one year expedition that led to a 3 day battle where many of his man and many natives were killed. After that, he sent out many smaller parties in all different directions looking for treasure. In June of 1604 he went out on his last expedition in search of gold. Juan de OÃ±ate and his 30 men went to the Colorado River and the Gulf of California but still found no gold. In 1607 he resigned from governor. He died in 1630.
 The video posted is Indians revealing their feelings for OÃ±ate. The speaker in the video talks about better years to come. I found the video interesting due to what some of the signs say and what happens in the end. Most of the signs talk about the brutality OÃ±ate delivered and others even compare him to Hitler.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=AsW2NKiD6C8</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >AsW2NKiD6C8</guid><pubDate>Wed, 1 Jul 1598 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><geo>34.8964, -107.5819</geo></item>
    <item><title><![CDATA[Pocahontas (Rebecca Rolfe)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Matoaka was born in 1595, to the great chief of the Powhatan Chiefdom, Wahunsenaca, and an unknown mother who has been theorized by historians to have passed away during childbirth. Matoaka received the nickname â€œPocahontasâ€ which translated to â€œplayful oneâ€, due to her inquisitive nature and spirited attitude. Pocahontas lived in a Chiefdom with a population of about 25,000 which contained over 30 Algonquian, a family of North American Indian languages, speaking tribes in their homeland of â€œTsenacomocoâ€. 
        
Pocahontas first came in contact with the English in May of 1607, when they arrived in Virginia. Her first encounter with the English was during the period of time that Captain John Smith was captured by her tribesmen. Smith survived the internment and was noted in several published accounts to have developed a friendship with Pocahontas and her homeland tribesmen. Pocahontas, accompanied by her trusted tribesmen, became an emissary for the Powhatan and conducted many trades with the English at the Jamestown settlement. After a year of hostilities and conflict between the English and Pocahontasâ€™s people, her visits to Jamestown were unable to occur any further. In 1609, John Smith returned to England when he was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion. Pocahontas was informed that John Smith had passed away.

In 1610, Pocahontas married Kocoum, a Pamunkey man. They became established in the Potomac region. In 1613, Pocahontas was taken captive and shipped back to Jamestown. The English settlers demanded items that had been stolen from them to be returned and for an abundance of corn. Pocahontas served as the peace treaty between the English and Powhatan tribe.  In 1613, Pocahontas met her soon to be husband, John Rolfe. After returning to the Powhatan village with the Englishmen who were demanding the other half of their ransom, Pocahontas asked for consent from her father to marry John Rolfe. Powhatan blessed his daughterâ€™s marriage, which was viewed as the peace-making matrimony on April 5th of that year. In 1614, Pocahontas decided to convert over to Christianity and change her name to Rebecca. 

Rebecca Rolfe, also known as Pocahontas, gave birth to a healthy son named Thomas, in which they traveled to England two years later. Pocahontas was photographed in Elizabethan styled clothing, which was a large change from her original attire. While in England, she reunited with John Smith after finding out that he is still alive. This was the last meeting between Pocahontas and John Smith. The Rolfe family decided to trek back to Virginia in 1617. Soon after this decision, Pocahontas became too ill to accompany her family in the voyage. At the age of twenty-two, Pocahontas is theorized to have died from tuberculosis or pneumonia. The true illness that she contracted is unknown to this day. She was buried in a graveyard in Gravesend, England.

To this day, Pocahontas is known for her bravery and dynamic role in the existence of the early colony. Pocahontas is one of the most well-known women of early American history. Although her life was cut short by disease, Pocahontas made an impact for many centuries after her lifetime that changed history as we know it.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Anne Hutchinson]]></title><description><![CDATA[As discussed in class, Puritan women were held to strict and oppressive standards of conduct. Puritan women were directed to obey the word of God and of her male superiors. As a Puritan woman living in the Massachusettsâ€™s Bay Colony during the early seventeenth century, Anne Hutchinson was expected to follow the strict social order put in place by the colonyâ€™s Puritan Clergy. The clergy not only ran the religious affairs of the colony, but doubled as the governing body of the colony. In November of 1637, Hutchinson was put on trial for heresy. John Winthrop, governor of the colony at this time, persecuted Hutchinson for running religious bible meeting out of her home. By holding these assemblies in her home and outside of the clergy authority, Winthrop viewed Hutchinson as a threat to the clergy and in clear violation of Puritan beliefs/practices. Hutchinson proposed that people need not listen to the word of ministers and instead hold conversation with God on an individualistic basis outside of the teachings put forward by the church/clergy. Due to the threat Hutchinson posed to the authority of the colonial church she was exiled from the Massachusettsâ€™s Bay Colony. 
        
Side Note: In 1987, Hutchinson was pardoned from her crimes on judicial record.

The YouTube link is a segment from a PBS Documentary directed by David Belton that re-enacts the Anne Hutchinson Trial 
that took place in November of 1637 with presiding Governor, John Winthrop, of the Massachusettsâ€™s Bay Colony as her persecutor/accuser.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Thomas Morton]]></title><description><![CDATA[Thomas Morton is an American colonist who is best known for his only literally work, the New English Canaan, which he wrote in 1637. In this book he discusses the Indians, Puritans, and the Separatists. Thomas Morton came to America in 1622. After two years of being there, in 1624 he helped establish a new colony called Mount Wollaston, which was named after the captain that he came to America with. In 1626, many of the people from this colony left to find a better environment to live. Morton did not want to leave so he stayed behind and set up a trading post that he renamed Mare Mount or Merrymount. In Merrymount he put up a maypole, which is a tall wooden pole that is used is European cultures. Mortonâ€™s maypole angered many neighboring colonies, which included Separatist Puritans and he was arrested in 1628 and was sent to England. He came back to America in 1629, where he fought the charges that were placed against him. He then again returned to England and worked with Anti-Puritan authorities. Then he came back to American once more in 1643 and was put into prison again in 1644. He died in Maine two years later.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Samuel de Champlain]]></title><description><![CDATA[Samuel de Champlain was born in France in 1572.  He was also often called the " Father of New France". He founded the city of Quebec and helped colonize New France. In 1603, Champlain sailed to North America and explored the St. Lawrence river. In 1608, he went to North America again to set up a fur trading post, which is when he founded Quebec, which in now  part of Canada. He also became co-owner of the Quebec Nordiques of the National Hockey League. In 1609, Champlain became friends with some living near Quebec and together they defeated the Iroquois. Champlain was also the first to reach a large body of water, which was eventually named Lake Champlain. After Quebec was taken by the English, Champlain was taken prisoner. Quebec was later returned to France and in 1633 Champlain sailed back to Quebec and rebuilt his original fort. This time he built it stronger. He won New World Fort of the Year. Champlain lived a fulfilling life and died in 1635.  The video posted is a brief biography of Champlain with a few more details.]]></description><link>http://www.dipity.com/ebb8/Early-American-Literature/?eid=wBX-NrAReYU</link><guid isPermaLink="false" >wBX-NrAReYU</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 1572 12:00:00 EDT</pubDate><geo>46.829853, -71.254028</geo></item>

Champlain was a French explorer and was known for founding the city of Quebec in 1608. In 1603, he sailed to new France as a member of a fur-trading expedition.

In 1629, Quebec was captured by the English and was taken to England to spend four years in exile. In 1632, New France was restored to France and Champlain returned. He died on Christmas day in 1635.

    <item><title><![CDATA[The Virgin of Guadalupe appears to Juan Diego]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego and told him that she wanted a church built on Tepeyac Hill and she told him to tell the church authorities. Juan de ZumÃ¡rraga was the first bishop of Mexico and did not believe that she had appeared to Juan Diego. So the Virgin appeared to Juan Diego again and told him to go see the bishop again, and when Juan Diego did so, the Bishop asked him for proof. The Virgin appeared a third time to Juan Diego who wanted him to come back the next day. Finally the Virgin appeared a fourth time to Juan Diego on December 12th, 1531 and told Juan Diego to go and get some roses for her. He got the flowers and wrapped them up because it was winter time. Juan Diego took the flowers to the bishop and an image of the Virgin was on the roses. This was the bishops proof.
        
The Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego multiple times on Tepeyac Hill, bringing together the Aztec and the Spanish conquerors. She is now a very important symbol in the Mexican culture.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Thomas More's Utopia is published.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<i>Utopia</i> is a fictitious story written by Thomas More. It is set on an island focusing mainly on communism and paganism, and taken over by reason. This story is said to have come from a person who has traveled to this island, and wants to prove that communism is needed to take away egoism. <i>Utopia</i> has several different subjects included in it, such as societies of different religions and the rights of women.
        
Many people believe that More got his ideas from the Mayan and Incan cultures in the mind of Raphael Hythloday, the main character. <i>Utopia</i>, in itself, kind of explains this fantasy of an ideal society. For example, the Europeans would go as far as to declare war on the native Americans if they thought the land was being wasted. They wanted to take over this land, and put it to "better" use with something like agriculture. This is
also know as <b>vacuum domicilium</b>, a term we have come to discover in this
class. Vacuum domicilium helps Europeans to discover the "perfect" colonial utopia in America, what More was attempting to describe in this text.

Here is one of the sites I used when research this topic.

I also used some of the things from our book and from Dr. Beshero-Bondar from class.

    <item><title><![CDATA[Bartolome de las Casas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las Casas was born in Seville, and his father sailed Columbusâ€™s second expedition to the New World. Bartolome seen what Columbus brought back both times (metals, foods, etc.), and that is what he wanted to do. At the age of 18, Las Casas set sail for Hispaniola as a soldier. Upon reaching Hispaniola, he was granted land and one hundred native slave laborers. I want to point out here that Las Casas was a willing participant in these harsh acts towards the Indians before he even set sail for Hispaniola. However, after witnessing a bloody conflict between the Natives and the Spanish, known as the conflict of Cuba, his view changed. He then became a priest and advocated for the Indians. He wrote many journals of the accounts he had. One of his best known journals is the one in our book, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. He said that the treatment and killings of the Indians were against the church, and tried to save the rest of the Indians. Las Casas had many experiments in which he wanted the Indians and Spanish to live together, and show that the Indians were peaceful. However, many things delayed this process and by then, the tensions between these groups were too much to overcome.  After many years of exploring and advocating, Las Casas died in 1566 in Madrid. 
        
This video is a reading of one of his journals, talking about one of
Christopher Columbus' voyages and what he saw, as a
supplement to what we read in the textbook (Heath Anthology of American Literature), with some good visual aids.
